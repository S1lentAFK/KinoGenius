    "reviewBody": "When I went to see this movie, I went in with high hopes and I was not disappointed. I enjoy Reese as an actor, and am becoming a fan of Mark Ruffalo&apos;s. Reese, as always, was the perfect main character that you just fell in love with from the very beginning and I really like Mark&apos;s ability to be a very physical actor, which Just Like Heaven took wonderful advantage of. The movie&apos;s storyline is good, it does have a couple of somewhat predictable turns, but what movie doesn&apos;t? The acting is very well done, I haven&apos;t laughed that much in a very long time and Reese and Mark have great chemistry on-screen. If you are looking for a really good chick flick to make you laugh, cry, and feel every motion in between, this is a great movie for you.",
