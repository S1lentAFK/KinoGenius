    "reviewBody": "I felt the need to sign up and review a movie for the first time, just so there would be more written about this lovely little movie. This is a real gem that seems to have slipped through the net, which is a real pity. I had no expectations and knew nothing about it when I stumbled upon it, and I have been trying to persuade all of my friends to see it since then.\\n\\nIt&apos;s one of those rare family movies that really feels authentic. There&apos;s nothing hokey here, and no obvious, cheesy dialog. The little directorial flourishes are sweet and unobtrusive and flow naturally with the story, which although sometimes whimsically told, has a deeply moving center. \\n\\nJulianne Moore deftly handles an extremely tricky role. She manages to convey the complexities in a character that on the surface, and in lesser hands, could read as drippy and one-dimensional. Instead as we see this woman&apos;s challenging life play out, we respect her more and more, and truly feel invested in what becomes of her remarkable spirit. \\n\\nAll in all, a wonderful surprise, beautifully executed. See it.",
