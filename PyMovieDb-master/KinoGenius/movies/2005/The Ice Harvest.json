    "reviewBody": "I also saw this film at the Virginia Film Festival, but I must disagree with the other fellow who wrote it up. I loved it. I&apos;m not a huge Cusack fan, but I have to say he does a great job carrying this small, gritty, character-driven film. And I thought Oliver Platt was great throughout. It&apos;s a terrific script, too, co-written by none other than Robert Benton. Kudos to Harold Ramis for having the guts to make this indie film! Is it commercial? Is it going to make a lot at the B.O.? No, it&apos;s not. It&apos;s another WONDER BOYS. It&apos;s another BIG LEBOWSKI. It&apos;s another CUTTER&apos;S WAY. It&apos;s another NOBODY&apos;S FOOL. Won&apos;t make money, but who cares... It was a delight to watch and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll see it again on a big screen and own it on DVD.",
