    "reviewBody": "The main character is ridiculous trying to look like a physics expert, while being an ignorant. This movie makes a mess out of very basic physics lows, like: speed * mass = acceleration!!! I can understand that the script maker could have missed his 14 years old physics classes, but I cannot accept that nobody working on the movie was able to notice. The movie is very emotional, showing good life lessons, encouraging the children to become good skaters. The story of the movie is good, the actors play well, but it remains a bad after taste because of how ignorant were all the persons involved in the movie. Consumer protection organization should react.",
