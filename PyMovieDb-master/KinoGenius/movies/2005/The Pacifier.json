    "reviewBody": "There not all that much to say defiantly not great but given the target audience it delivers on that nice hour and a half of no bad taste in mouth 'entertainment' just not being too memorable doesn't mean it's boring -for an adult audience sure but you gotta remember the demographics\n\nand i do think it' a shame we don't some some actors such as vine in more comedies an exploring the edges of their talent... a shame there's a lot of talent wasted generally speaking\n\nif you're an adult obviously i wouldn't recommend but if you're a family then there are much worse options for you to end up watching to kill time/entertain the ids.",
