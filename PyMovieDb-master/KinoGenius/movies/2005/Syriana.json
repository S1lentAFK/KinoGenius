    "reviewBody": "Connex loses its access in Kazahkstan by its Emir which is then given to the Chinese. Connex is merging with the smaller Killen to get back into the region. Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst in Geneva. He attends the Emir's party where his son is accidentally killed. Reformer Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig) offers him reparation and eventually takes him on as his adviser. Meanwhile, there is a secret missile sale in Iran that ends explosively. Bob Barnes (George Clooney) is a hard-nosed CIA operative trying to stop the arms smuggling. He clashes with his superiors and then assigned to assassinate Nasir.\n\nIt's an ambitious movie that would confuse the most fanatical of conspiracy theorists. It's a complicated interconnected series of stories. It's tough to keep it all straight. In this case, the confusion adds to the appeal of the movie. It highlights the murky nature of dealings within that region.",
