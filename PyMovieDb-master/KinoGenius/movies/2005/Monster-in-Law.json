    "reviewBody": "I had such a thrill watching the unsinkable Jane Fonda making a wonderful fool of herself that I&apos;ve actually saw it twice. The second time with my thumb on the fast forward. I&apos;ve watched Jane&apos;s Viola interview that Brittany Spears clone many, many times. It&apos;s outrageously close to the knuckle and Fonda goes for it, body and soul. The problem resides elsewhere. I hope Jennifer Lopez has someone around her who can tell her the truth. She is so bad that the film can&apos;t recover from the heaviness of her romantic turns. She is the iceberg to this particular titanic. There is not a moment of sincerity in her entire performance and the fact that she is standing opposite one of the most truthful of actresses in the history of acting makes her appearance all the more jarring. Jane please, gives as more, Jennifer, go back to school.",
