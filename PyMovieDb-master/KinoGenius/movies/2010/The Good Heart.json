    "reviewBody": "This is a must see movie - goes on my list all time favorites.\n\nIt is not a thriller but there is never a dull moment. It is no comedy either yet there were several occasions where I was laughing so hard that I was almost out of breath. It&apos;s difficult to classify.\n\nThe script has everything. Excellent plot, really fantastic dialogs, interesting characters, unexpected turns and a surprise ending... a great story and its well told.\n\nThe quality is excellent: filming, lighting, soundtrack, props, costumes ... everything. \n\nBrian Cox is fantastic as the grumpy bar owner... Paul Dano is convincing as the homeless young man.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this film.",
