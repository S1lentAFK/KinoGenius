    "reviewBody": "This Disney movie is fun and the effects are first grade.\n\nNicolas Cage is good as expected. Same goes to Alfred Molina and it&apos;s always nice to see Monica Bellucci.\n\nBUT, there is one BIG problem and that is Jay Baruchel. Why, o why, they had to put him into this movie? He ruined it completely with his annoying appearance, voice and, above all, irritating not-at-all-talented acting. They should have find different actor for this role. I don&apos;t have someone in mind but this one is very wrong. Without him it would be a much better movie.\n\nBut, it&apos;s still entertaining, in spite of occasional not funny jokes which are forced into scenario. The story is bearable and neat effects pulls it out of average, slightly.",
