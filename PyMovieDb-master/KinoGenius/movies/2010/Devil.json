    "reviewBody": "Wow! This film took 'inspired by RRR' very seriously, although I am not complaining. DEVIL is a surprisingly superb film that nicely blends patriotic action drama with a scintillating mystery. The first half is all about a murder investigation, and slowly the whole affair unfolds in the second half. The writing is neat, and the direction is good too. The film has some technical issues, and the fight in the climax goes in a 'too much' direction. But despite its flaws, DEVIL is a solid period mystery action about INA.\\n\\nI am so happy to see Kalyan Ram choosing such different projects rather than sticking to those boring mass template films. It's really sad to see this film fail, but I hope he doesn't get disheartened, and chooses similar projects in the future that are different from the usual template affairs. Well done team!",
