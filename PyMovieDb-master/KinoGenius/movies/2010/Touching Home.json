    "reviewBody": "I&apos;d read the Miller brothers book (YOU&apos;RE EITHER IN, OR YOU&apos;RE IN THE WAY), when it first came out a few months ago and have been itching to see their film ever since. I was finally able to catch the film at a wonderful sneak preview screening, in the awesome Smith Rafael Film Center. And I was even able to chat with the filmmakers afterward. What a treat!\n\nThe Miller brothers have created a work of art out of literally nothing. As a feature film producer myself, I know what kind of determination and stamina this takes and my hat goes off to them for a job (extremely) well done. The long hours, sleepless nights, anxiety and frustration all becomes worth it, when you sit in the theater and see your finished product screened before an audience.\n\nEd Harris was remarkable (as always), the story was simple yet complex and emotionally poignant. The cinematography was beautiful and subtle. I liked that it wasn&apos;t over stylized and just allowed the characters and their journey to be the main focal point of the film. TOUCHING HOME is a great little &apos;slice of life&apos; movie, that touches the heart and speaks eloquently to the depth of human relationships and loss.\n\nI hope that this calling card piece ignites the careers of these talented guys. Bravo to the entire cast/crew!",
