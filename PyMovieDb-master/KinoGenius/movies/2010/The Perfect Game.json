    "reviewBody": "This dramatization of the 1957 World Little League Champions is just a terrific watch - sure, it is a little clich√©d in places - but what sports movie isn&apos;t, but it has the same vibe as The Mighty Ducks and The Bad News Bears except that is based on a true story.\n\nAll in all, baseball films are nearly always good to watch, and this is no exception - the team is fun, the story is built well, the film is nicely edited, you get a ton of baseball, and the moral compass is firmly fixed to good throughout.\n\nOne of the better sports films for kids - and adults - and one that deserves a wide audience.",
