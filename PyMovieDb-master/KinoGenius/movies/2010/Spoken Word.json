    "reviewBody": "This movie has no reviews, and I stumbled upon it in my ratings list, and remembered how good it was. I know probably no human soul will read this as this film was released at only a few small film festivals. I caught this movie at the Los Angeles Latino Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised. \n\nI saw it 4 years ago and I still remember enough about it to write a review. The film dealt with a re-entrance to the world of drugs by an aspiring artist. The film carried a deep message as to what comes along with the addiction of drugs, and how it cannot save you from the heartbreak of losing a loved one. Not only does it not save you from the problems, but it makes them worse.\n\nI remember walking out of the theater, a mere 12 year old (give or take), shaken by the emotional content of this film including it&apos;s depiction of drug addiction.",
