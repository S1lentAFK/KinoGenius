    "reviewBody": "Short, sweet, and funny. At least I think it&apos;s supposed to be funny. Interesting concept to pretend your girlfriend/wife is her twin sister for variety. My wife liked it. \n\nAs a short filmmaker myself, I think this was a sweet film. It had an idea. I don&apos;t think many people understand the La Nouvelle Vague stuff, like over-saturation and deep focus but I got it. Clever.\n\nThe animation maybe didn&apos;t work for me. I think it might have been better as a live-action film. I thought the animation was a little flat.\n\nBut nice homage to Charlie Kaufman.",
