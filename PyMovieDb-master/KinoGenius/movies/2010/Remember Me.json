    "reviewBody": "I have no idea why people/critics are panning this film. Were we watching the SAME film??? \n\nRob is fantastic in this. He shows true depth, feeling and understanding of this character. The female lead is refreshing. \n\nThe film is about love/relationships and family. NOT a romantic comedy so why anyone would complain that it didn&apos;t tick the boxes of some pointless romcon i don&apos;t know. It never said it WAS a romantic comedy!!! The ending is apt and beautifully done. It wasn&apos;t tacky in any shape or form. I commend Rob in choosing to do this film.\n\nWell done mate.",
