    "reviewBody": "I'm not sure why anyone would see this as an affront to men and boys in general, but I guess that's why we are so different in seeing things and describing them. While for me this does have too much music (two songs less would be nice) and too little of the snowman we came to enjoy in the trailer, it still is a more than satisfying movie.\n\nDoes it have stereotypes and some weird characters (the round ones, you'll see, when you see them)? Yes absolutely! But does it stand in the way of the story? Never. Even the twist, which is a nice one, can be seen as either good or bad. I liked it, even though it was convenient, but you needed it with the story at hand. There is some darker passages here, but it still is a children's story. One that works",
