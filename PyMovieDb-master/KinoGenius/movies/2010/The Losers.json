    "reviewBody": "The Losers delivers a great deal of pleasure. It was witty, funny, interesting and a marvelous watch. This comedy is like a parody of hardcore action films, so don&apos;t expect any mind-blowing depth. Just go with the flow. It&apos;s fun.\n\nI hadn&apos;t any significant expectations for this movie, so the enjoyment was even bigger. At times the plot might be a bit predictable but that doesn&apos;t disturb the ride at all. It&apos;s got fast pace, entertaining action scenes and it&apos;s fun. Fun is the word here. The cast was brilliant, as well. Zoe Saldana was great as always. And for the first time i felt that Chris Evans (Push-junk and Fantasticless 4) did a good job. The villain was a bit weak though. But descent acting carried the movie for the whole time. All you need.\n\nAs long as you don&apos;t take it seriously, it is brilliant and you won&apos;t be disappointed. Shoot &apos;em up!",
