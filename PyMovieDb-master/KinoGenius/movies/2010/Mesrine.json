    "reviewBody": "Jacques Mesrine (1936 - 1979) was a well-known French criminal, getting himself a name for robbing banks and a number of murders. After having received a huge ransom for kidnapping a French millionaire in 1979, French authorities declared him &apos;Public Enemy Number One&apos;. They increased their efforts to track Mesrine down, and executed him without a trial shortly afterwards. While imprisoned earlier on, Mesrine wrote his autobiography.\n\n&apos;Public Enemy Number One - Part 1&apos; reflects the first part of this criminal&apos;s adult life. Starting in the late fifties in Algeria, where French soldier Jacques Mesrine served in the foul war of independence, we get a clear picture of his development as a master-criminal.\n\nAlthough I think it difficult to judge the historical precision of its plot, this very French film surely makes a good watch. Male lead Vincent Cassel acts a convincing Jacques Mesrine, and the many supporting roles shine with equal quality. The parts 1 and 2 of &apos;Public enemy Number One&apos; provide a real blockbuster that sticks to the mind.\n\nFor the fans of Ludivine Sagnier. She isn&apos;t in this Part 1, but will appear in Part 2.",
