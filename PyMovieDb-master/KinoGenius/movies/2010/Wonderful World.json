    "reviewBody": "This is a smart, satisfying film, and a triumph for Broderick. We haven&apos;t seen such a great anti-establishment hero since The Big Lebowski.\n\nAll the characters are brilliantly written by Goldin, and, likewise, brilliantly portrayed by the actors. Matthew Broderick&apos;s performance as Ben Singer has an assured and measured nuance -- a really fine role. Michael Williams (Ibu) shows his impressive range with a wonderful character, so distinct from his iconic Omar on The Wire. Sanaa Lathan&apos;s Khadi is a strong memorable sensual beauty. Twelve year old Jodelle Ferland as Sandra, Ben&apos;s daughter, is a revelation and certainly a comer.\n\nWonderful World will make you laugh and it will make you cry. You want to go see this flick.",
