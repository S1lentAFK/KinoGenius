    "reviewBody": "As first: The actors are very good. Second: The special effects are awesome. Third: There's a story to it.\n\nThis is a great movie that you nearly never see any more. It's got a fun theme: Wild west, and it is kind of a superhero movie. If you look at the new movie: Cowboys & Aliens, then Jonah Hex looks way better. Also the actors were great. There are quit some famous actors, like Megan Fox, and the roles are also being played very well.\n\nThe special effects I can describe in one word: Awesome. Every special effect is well done, like the huge explosions. Also the clothes and view is very western and good.\n\nThe story is well thought. There is a real storyline, not like there isn't in some other movies, like scary movie 4.\n\nThe only thing that is a bit of a pity is that the movie is only one hour and nineteen minutes. That is really short.\n\nSo there for I give the movie as rating: 8",
