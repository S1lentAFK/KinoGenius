    "reviewBody": "This has to be one of the best films I have watched of late. Everything you would wish it to be. Very tense at times and keeps you on edge. Great acting from Russell Crowe and the story is very smart and gripping. Not as predictable as some films seem to be when using a similar storyline to this. Very entertaining all the way through from start to finish with no gaps which is always good for a film that exceeds 2 hours in duration. A very different performance from Crowe which we don&apos;t offer see, but be played it very well, and very powerful. Definitely a must watch. Don&apos;t wait around for this one, I would strive to watch it straight away for those that haven&apos;t done so yet.",
