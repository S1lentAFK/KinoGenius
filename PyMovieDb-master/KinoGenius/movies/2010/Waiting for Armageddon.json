    "reviewBody": "This film doesn&apos;t try to shock you. It invites you to sit in with a church as they make their pilgrimage to The Holy Land. Creepiness ensues. The filmmakers focus on de-contextualizing ordinary attitudes from suburban American Christian culture by presenting them to a general audience, peppering the Cinema-Verite with commentary from a slightly biased semetic cast of scholars.\n\nThe criticism touches on the subject&apos;s historical ignorance and penchant for violence but focuses more on the general hubris of Christianity in America. The judgement is delivered quietly, giving the viewer a feeling of coming to his own conclusions.\n\nBias aside, there is a fantastic scene where the Christians are talking loudly outside the Dome Of The Rock about apocalyptic prophecy. The attendants of the holy tourist attraction apprehensively approach the offenders and beg them to please be quiet. You don&apos;t need a scholar providing commentary to lead you to any conclusions here.",
