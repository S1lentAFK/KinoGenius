    "reviewBody": "Ironically, I picked this over the documentary &apos;Armadillo&apos; about the war in Afghanistan, because I didn&apos;t feel like watching a truly frightening and disturbing movie that night. I felt like watching something &apos;fictionally scary&apos;. It seems I should have gone for the war documentary instead, this movie had me wrecked emotionally for days. The story kind of clings, you have to deal with it, but it&apos;s complex and hard. It&apos;s a challenging movie.\n\nWhat keeps riddling me about this movie, is how on earth did anyone manage to make me feel sympathetic towards the main character, who&apos;s an occasionally psychotic, cynical and brutal sadist? Even when he loses his temper completely with consequences beyond anything you thought you would ever watch on the big screen, you find yourself on his side.\n\nNow, it&apos;s not an uncommon ambition for a director to construct &apos;bad&apos; characters with compelling sides that awaken your sympathy, but this is beyond my comprehension. He&apos;s not a character you feel sorry for, he&apos;s not playing the victim anywhere, he&apos;s a sadist out of control. He plans things carefully to serve his own purposes and explodes in violence. Still, you want him to make it. You are left for hours thinking and discussing why on earth you found yourself supporting this character. Why would anybody?!? I don&apos;t know how this was done, it is, as I said, disturbing.\n\nI was thinking about this for days, I&apos;m still thinking about it. There are many story lines to examine in retrospect, there&apos;s his childhood, the violence, the biblical figures and references, the forbidden sexual urges, the gender dynamics of the time and how Hudson and Albas characters are both in their own way revolting them. Casey Affleck gives a scarily brilliant performance, and Kate Hudson deserves compliments on her fantastic performance as the classical &apos;good girl of good family&apos; of the 1950s who hides both a great social insight and a dark side.\n\nThe Killer Inside Me is a great conversation starter, my boyfriend and I discussed this for hours (and we are far from an intellectual movie-discussing couple). Americans should be warned though, this is without a doubt one of the most graphical violent Hollywood productions I have ever seen.",
