    "reviewBody": "De Niro , Norton and Jovovich . Quite the cast I&apos;d say , but thats all there is to it .\n\nThe start is really interesting , both De Niro and Norton giving top notch performances . But then everything is lost as the movie looses focus and struggles to define itself . What starts of as a thriller goes nowhere trying to answer existential questions . No character is developed enough , the background stories clumsy and incomplete and thats in my opinion what killed this movie . No cohesion and a weak ending is the coup de grace .\n\nEdward Norton is one of my favorite actors , so is De Niro . Im so disappointed that this didn&apos;t work out .",
