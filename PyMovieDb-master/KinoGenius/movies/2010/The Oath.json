    "reviewBody": "The Oath\n\nLike most films I&apos;ve seen lately, I either don&apos;t know anything about it, or I&apos;ve only seen a teaser trailer. I had no idea that this was a near literal interpretation of the believed texts that formed the Book of Mormon.\n\nI have no problem with religious films. There are the most amazing theories posed in even the greatest of fiction that touch on divinity and faith, so why not enjoy a writer&apos;s perception of non fiction, and see where it goes?\n\nWell, in this film, it goes absolutely nowhere. This movie could have been 10-15 minutes long. The overly dramatic acting of Moroni is so bad that even Billy Zane&apos;s character smirks and rolls his eyes. I don&apos;t really think he was acting when that happened.\n\nThe plot isn&apos;t bad, in theory. The usual Romeo and Juliet-esque love affair unfolds between two warring sects, ending in tragedy. It&apos;s really the acting and the cinematography in which lies the flaws.\n\nI did enjoy the music as the composer did a great job working with a really bad script. I know that the lead actor, director, writer (all the same person) feels he did a heartfelt interpretation, because he says so before the movie starts, but my goodness did this flop.\n\nGo and see for yourself, especially if you are of the Mormon faith. Maybe you&apos;ll see more than I did.",
