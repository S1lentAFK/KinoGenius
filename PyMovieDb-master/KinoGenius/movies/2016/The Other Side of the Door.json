    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve read a lot of bad reviews slating this movie, I get why. Don&apos;t go into this movie expecting a great horror movie, it&apos;s not really a horror. It is however a really good tragedy which is portrayed using a medium of creepy devices. If you leave this movie and all you have is &apos;lame jump scares&apos;, you&apos;re missing the point of the story. If you&apos;re considering watching this, do it, it&apos;s worth the 1 hour 35. Each of the actors does a pretty stand up job, the direction and photography went well, my only gripe would be the editing. The flow of the story looked like it wanted to be a horror movie, when it should have looked like a &apos;Del Toro&apos;.",
