    "reviewBody": "Anesthesia is a good title referencing the methods people use to escape, deal with and numb life&apos;s myriad of pain as opiates like pot, heroin, alcohol, sex, love, an affair, self-mutilation, charity, heroism and technology. Despite the huge impersonal gap caused by tech, this snapshot of one area shows how little our human dilemmas have changed and how interconnected we still can be. I enjoyed the storytelling, the acting and the philosophy. I do wish the end wasn&apos;t quite so abrupt though, leaving a feeling of loose ends.",
