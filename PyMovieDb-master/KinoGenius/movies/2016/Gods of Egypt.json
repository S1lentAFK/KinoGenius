    "reviewBody": "An entertaining mess that mixes Egyptian Gods and human beings in which the supreme God Ra : Geoffrey Rush has divided Egypt in two parts , the wealthy , prosperous region of River Nile governed by his son Osiris : Bryan Brown and the barren desert run by his another son Set, the relentless God of Darkness : Gerard Butler . But Set wants to take over Egypt's throne plunging the quiet kingdom into destruction , chaos and conflict . As during a spectacular coronation, Set kills his brother Osoris , then Horus : Nikolaj Costner Waldau , son of Osiris and Isis , escapes. Horus who blinded by his uncle is hidden and useless to carry out a merciless vengeance . Then Horus -The Falcon God- is unexpectedly helped by a young human named Bek : Brenton Thwaites who makes a deal with him to save his sweetheart Zaya : Courtney Eaton , who was taken captive, as she encounters in the infraworld to be judged by the death Gods . All of Heaven is at War . All of Creation is at stake . The Journey of a Lifetime begins . The most powerful force on Universe is about to be unleashed . The Battle for Eternity Begins .\\n\\n A noisy and bombastic adventure with plenty of 3D computer generator special effects , mayhem , and total destruction . It is a cheesy fun in the Saturday Matinee tradition with abundant and overwhelming battles , noisy action and breathtaking fights . A loudy and crowdy epic movie about Egyptian Gods marred by its exccessive FX and lots of scenes with no much sense . Here shows up ordinary contrivances with giant Gods , impressive palaces that are destroyed by violent fights , witchery , bizarre beasts and enormous monsters . Main and support cast are pretty well . Along with newcomers actors as Brenton Thwaites , Courtney Eaton , Elodie Young , the recently deceased Chadwick Boseman , there appears veteran players as Gerard Butler , Geoffrey Rush , Bryan Brown , all of them are frankly well .\\n\\nIt displays a brilliant and sunny cinematography with full of color by Peter Menzies Jr. As well as a moving and rousing musical score by Marco Beltrani . The motion picture was professionally directed by Alex Proyas , though hindered by its overlong runtime and too much visual effects . Alex Proyas is a good filmmaker who has directed successful films such as : The Raven, Dark City, Garage Days , I Robot , Knowing , among others . Rating : 6/10 . Worthwhile seeing .",
