    "reviewBody": "Wow.......\n\nIt is always pleasant to go into a movie with no expectations, and this one delivered in spades.\n\nAny story starts with... well a great story, and this is it, although somewhat predictable it&apos;s more a comforting predictable, a good guy wins story with enough great twists in it to keep the interest.\n\nThe cast here lifts the game, who knew Affleck had this in him, and supported by the ever sweet Kendrick (all be it with a kick-ass moment), and throw in favorites like Simmons (Terminator Genisys) and Addai-Robinson (Shooter), all playing their respective parts well.\n\nThe scene with Affleck&apos;s and Kendrick&apos;s characters having lunch showed great subtly in writing, directing and acting. A lot of dry and subtle humor throughout.\n\nNo overdone CGI either, just good clean action, regularly punctuating the plot, with the clean cinematography only adding to clinical nature of our lead character.\n\nFor the run-of-the-mill action flick, you shouldn&apos;t pass this one up.",
