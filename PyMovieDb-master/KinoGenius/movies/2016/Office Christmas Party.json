    "reviewBody": "Nothing nothing awkward or cheesy. Perfectly paced, perfect characther building in such a short amount of time. Perfectly timed and subtle jokes and pretty great acting.\n\nEven the hundreds of extra's were flawlessly directed.\n\nGood laughs and no restrictons. They went all out in a very un-American way.\n\nKudos to the director.",
