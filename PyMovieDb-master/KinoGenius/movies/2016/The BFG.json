    "reviewBody": "I do understand that people are disappointed when watching a Kids movie and expecting an exciting and challenging plot. What is wrong with you guys? Just because it says Steven Spielberg doesn&apos;t mean this is a movie that is specifically designed for your needs. I am 30+ and I like this movie a lot, watching it from a kids perspective you even understand the breakfast scene and I bet all kids would laugh at it. It is kinda sad, seeing how incapable some people are recognizing a movie for kids as such. This is a proper 8! I like the accent, the CGI is fitting, the story is for kids, so if you are not a kid, stfu. I can fully recommend it to anybody with an open mind, who is not looking for the kids version of an Captain America Civil War CGI fest.",
