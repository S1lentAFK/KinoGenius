    "reviewBody": "Rafe Khatchadorian is a troubled student who is obsessed with his drawings. Jules (Lauren Graham) is his single mom and Bear (Rob Riggle) is her annoying boyfriend. Georgia is his smart-mouth sister. He starts at a strict new school run by the Principal Dwight and VP Stricker. He finds fellow troublemaker Leo attending the last chance school. Mr. Teller (Adam Pally) is his loose teacher. Leo talks him into breaking all the rules.\\n\\nIt&apos;s sporadically fun in a childish coming of age movie. The adults are one dimensional or half dimensional. There are a few too many jerks. It&apos;s unnecessary for the maitre-D to be one. It&apos;s like Diary of a Wimpy Kid but less compelling. Rafe doesn&apos;t have the spunk. The kid playing Leo would be better. It&apos;s all a little bit unlikeable. They need a more charismatic lead.",
