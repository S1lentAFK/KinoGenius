    "reviewBody": "A story of Col. Patterson building a bridge over the river Tsavo in Africa, and fighting the couple of killer lions and builders scared to death. Firstly it&apos;s the views. Africa&apos;s all around with yellow, sun burnt, high grown grass moving in the wind (you can smell the scent almost) and the workers who can cast a threat to Patterson if he fails their expectations of killing the lions. Secondly Val Kilmer&apos;s performance. He&apos;s not acting, he&apos;s just there fighting the obstacles. Thirdly Mike Douglas&apos;s influential way of telling things. He&apos;s more convincing than in &apos;Basic Instinct&apos; and sorry Oliver, &apos;The Wall Street&apos;. His macho appearance doesn&apos;t interfere with the main plot but comes to be part of it. Last not least it&apos;s Jerry Goldsmith&apos;s music. I don&apos;t know how he did it but he made it perfect. You just have to sense it to feel it. One of my favourites.",
