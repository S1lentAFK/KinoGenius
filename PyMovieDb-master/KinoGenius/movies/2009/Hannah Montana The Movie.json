    "reviewBody": "When the film was released in 2009 I was in my early 20's and Miley a Cyrus was becoming the biggest thing In the world. Watching the film 12 years later my thought of the film had changed a lot. When first released I loved the film it's family fun Disney film aimed more at its target audience of preteen girls and teen to young adult girls. Now watching this as a 34 year old I see the film in different eyes.\n\nThe film is not a bad film like most people say it is it's a fun family film. It's silly and the acting is not the best but it is what it is.",
