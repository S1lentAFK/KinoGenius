    "reviewBody": "'Trick r Treat' is a comic-style anthology and the different tales are woven together pretty well. The direction is slick and the structure is sound.\n\nThe tales themselves are a mixed bag. Not bad but not stunning. \n\nThe injection of two or three decent actors gives it enough 'oomph' to lift it just above your average horror flick. Without the likes of Brian Cox and Dylan Baker I fear this may have slipped into the murky depths of DVD oblivion but, as I say, they do enough to keep it all watchable.\n\n'Trick r Treat' is silly fun that should please most horror fans.",
