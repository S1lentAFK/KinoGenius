    "reviewBody": "When I entered this one, I thought it would be another Kate Hudson/Matthew McConaughey, Richard Gere/Julia Roberts,Diane Lane, wuvvy-duvvey-cutesy-wootsy boring predictable love movie.\\n\\nI was completely wrong. We&apos;ve all seen movies that involve time travel and this one is near the top.\\n\\nIt shows the reality of a relationship between two individuals who have to deal with the negative effects of time travel in a close relationship.\\n\\nThis movie had me near tears at the end, which is truly sad since I haven&apos;t cried since the movie Beaches.\\n\\nThe only thing I didn&apos;t like about this movie was that I found myself trying to figure out this mans time travel and if it made sense. There are a few loose ends left untied.\\n\\nOther than that, the two leads were solid and the movie is entertaining. I wouldn&apos;t rush out to see it, but it is definitely worth renting.",
