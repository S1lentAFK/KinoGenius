    "reviewBody": "A funny look at the car sales game. It falls under the yeah right satire comedies. Along the same lines as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights and King Pin.\\n\\nI dig the way Jeremy Piven acts and he comes along with many of the re-used actors in this kind of movie, Will Ferrell, David Koechner, Rob Riggle, Ed Helms and others.\\n\\nThe movie is has a few funny parts and some outrageous, yeah right scenes. I think this movie was a cross between comedy and those Sunday morning car lot shows. If anything you can learn about the sales tricks that some of the car salesman use, protect yourself when you go to the car lots, do your homework and stick to your plans.\\n\\nIt is worth renting.",
