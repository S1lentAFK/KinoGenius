    "reviewBody": "Perfectly cliche, the princess and the frog is a truly heartwarming Disney movie. The characters are fun and well developed, the storyline flows well, and the animation is good. The songs didn't flow as seamlessly as I would have liked, the movie almost didn't need them. The characters made this movie, loved ray the lightning bug.",
