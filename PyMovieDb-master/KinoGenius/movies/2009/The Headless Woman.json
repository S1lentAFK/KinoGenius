    "reviewBody": "Vero (Maria Onetto) has run over something while traveling back home, but she's totally scared and shocked to stop and watch (was it a boy or a dog?). Instead, she just goes on... from that moment,for Vero its time to try to forget.\\n\\nBlames, ghosts, fears and uncertainties turn the third Lucrecia Martel's film into a masterpiece which will divide even to her fans. There are many feelings around the story and no one is completely shown or expressed. The clues to find out what Vero run over slowly appear but don't expect to understand clearly what happened, and neither understand what is she thinking nor feeling. Her head seems having stayed on the road where she had the accident and now is everything is dark and confused.\\n\\nLucrecia Martel's camera shoots the story in a society where the social differences are clear, but their characters are not aware of it.\\n\\nThe performances are quite good. Maria Onetto is so expressive! all of them are really involved with the film. Even In\\u00e9s Efr\\u00f3n is good! - because I still cant understand why critics said she was excellent in 'XXY'.\\n\\nAs I said, 'The headless woman' is not for everyone, ''it is confused ,too experimental and not totally resolved'' some wrote. But trust me, it's intelligent, different and sensitive. It is a road to nowhere, it is a map without any road. Because she has lost her head in that accident and as a viewer you just follow the road you may feel is the right to understand Vero and the story.\\n\\nThanks Lucrecia!... again.\\n\\n10/10",
