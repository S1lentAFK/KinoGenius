    "reviewBody": "Yes, this film is incredibly stupid and loud, but that's what you are getting yourself into. It's a purely entertaining popcorn blockbuster with exciting action and not much of a plot. For sure, the jokes are dumb and not much makes sense, but if you just want to pass the time, this film is a good way to do it.",
