    "reviewBody": "Nia, a little humility please. You are not all that you must think you are. And among those things you are not, you are not a young sexy heartthrob piece of eye candy. And why would you want to be? You can be so talented yet you choose to go down this path. Why? This movie lacked insight, passion, real emotion. It was paint by the numbers and you didn't even know how to count.\n\nYour role, persona in My Big Fat Greek Wedding fit you wonderfully. Why in the world would you want to ditch that intuitive, attractive on your own terms, bright, sexy in a girl-next-door sort of way? Take a big breath, step back and find that voice again. Please, for everyone's sake.",
