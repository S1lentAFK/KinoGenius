    "reviewBody": "A movie that starts semi-uninteresting, foggy, vague laced with unknowingness, but gradually takes beautiful shape, commitment, camaraderie, hidden pledge deep from the heart, backed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Dar Salim&apos;s charismatic acting, superb and haunting photography & filming, supersonic tech and weaponry and moments of intense despair, frustration and anger.\\n\\nMy initial reserve, doubt and thought of clich\\u00e9d repetitiveness quickly melted like snow in the sun. More than 85% of the movie seems and is realistic and that&apos;s an achievement by itself. Liked it very much and recommend it to any person with a deep sense of honor.\\n\\nWhen you think the end is near, a glimmer of hope bathes you in its light.\\n\\n\\n* Screenplay/story: 7\\n* Development: 8\\n* Realism: 8.5\\n* Entertainment: 8\\n* Acting: 8\\n* Filming/photography/cinematography: 8.5\\n* Visual/special effects: 8.5\\n* Music/score: 8\\n* Depth: 8.5\\n* Logic: 7\\n* Flow: 8.5\\n* Action/thriller/war: 8\\n* Ending: 8.\\n",
