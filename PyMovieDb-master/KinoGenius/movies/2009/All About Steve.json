    "reviewBody": "'All about Steve' may not be a favourite for many but I found it to be laugh out loud hilarious. There are inconsistencies concerning the story, sometimes the film loses focus and the ending is a little choppy but for me it was the very funny dialogues and performances by the actors that made this film laughable. I also liked the characters. Sandra Bullock is easily one of the best actresses today even though she remains underrated. As annoying as her character Mary might be, there is something likable about her, an innocence and intelligence that made it impossible for me to dislike her. What Bullock excellently demonstrates is that Mary is a very brainy person but she is socially handicapped and consequently people don't give themselves the opportunity to see a lovable, kind and caring side of her personality. Bullock is further brilliantly supported by Bradley Cooper, Ken Jeong, Katey Mixon and Thomas Haden Church (this guy should be in more movies). 'All About Steve' is all about laughing. There were so many moments that had me laughing hysterically that I would suggest that one ought to just enjoy the film without expecting too much of anything else.",
