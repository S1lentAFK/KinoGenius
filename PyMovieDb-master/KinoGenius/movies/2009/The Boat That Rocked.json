    "reviewBody": "What a cute flick! As a (former) film reviewer I have absolutely no desire to dissect or critique this movie. I&apos;m just taking it at face value. It&apos;s fun, uplifting and witty. It&apos;s obvious the cast had a hell of a good time making it (even the &apos;bad&apos; guys). Hoffman and Nighey are in top form. The gags are good, even when they tank. And the ending gave a surprising increase in the tension/suspense.\\n\\nReally can&apos;t find anything terribly wrong with this aside from the mild sexism but it&apos;s so subtle, I hardly noticed.\\n\\nI&apos;ve been going through a really rough time personally and watching this cheered me. What more could you hope for?",
