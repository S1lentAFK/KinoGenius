    "reviewBody": "Haven't seen a Kevin Costner movie in ages, I was looking forward to this solid horror. After his wife leaves him and his two kids, John James (Costner) and his children move to a isolated farm. But then, his daughter starts acting weird and it has something to do with a large mound near his home. Kevin Costner and the rest of the cast act well, but the star of the show is director Luis Berdejo for making a suspenseful, tense, well crafted thriller. Plenty of effective scares and a truly terrifying ending, The New Daughter is a solid horror film.\n\n7/10.\n\nRated PG-13 for strong violence.",
