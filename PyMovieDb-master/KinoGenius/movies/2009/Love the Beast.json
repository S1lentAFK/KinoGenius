His a Falcon (what we in the U.S. looks to be a Ford Torino) and mine a Dodge Charger. We both love our cars in a way that is hard to understand by someone who is not a serious gear head.\n\nThe documentary shows a love of cars by Mr. Bana and his friends growing up that had the same appreciation of the automobile\n\nSeeing this film makes me appreciate my love of muscle cars that much better.\n\nThe documentary contains an insightful cameo by TV host, Jay Leno. An annoying one by BBC Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson and something in-between by Dr. Phil McGraw.",
