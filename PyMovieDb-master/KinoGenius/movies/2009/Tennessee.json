    "reviewBody": "i had no expectations about this film and i knew very little about it. all i knew of it was that it was a slow-paced melodrama about a cross-country journey. so with that in mind, the end result was quite pleasing as the film is actually a good quality film. even though there are some areas of the film that can be worked on- the beginning being a tad bit fast, the end being a bit slow, and the fact that some scenes weren't developed enough to make you fully comprehend the characters' emotions- the film itself worked well enough to draw you in. this is a pretty sad film that has a great message behind it. it kind of hits you and makes you think about life and enjoying it while you can. also, the acting was pretty good. believe it or not, mariah carey actually made the film a lot more interesting to watch, and she proved she can act in some way. put behind her 'glitter' debacle and you'll see some pretty good performances from her. overall, i liked it better than it thought i would, and i would watch it again.",
