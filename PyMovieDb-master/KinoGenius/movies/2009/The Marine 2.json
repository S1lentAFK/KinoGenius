    "reviewBody": "M2 is an enjoyable, action-packed, suspenseful movie with exciting scenes and vibrant cinematography (the shots of the island resort were wish-I-was-there breath-taking). It does deserve its R-rating as the violence to and from the terrorists can be brutal at times.\\n\\nWhat I liked most is Ted&apos;s acting allows you to truly sympathize with Joe (Ted Dibiase) and how he&apos;d do anything to get his wife back. Joe (Ted) is not an over-the-top, emotional, screaming-maniac Marine hero; he keeps his cool, which is quite refreshing.\\n\\nI hope WWE does more of these action movies, and I look forward to seeing Ted in more of them. M2 went straight to video; yet, it was much better than some of the WWE films that came out in theaters.\\n\\nM2 is a good addition to your movie library. Will be watching this movie again.",
