    "reviewBody": "This movie is fun to watch with a bunch of friends. It&apos;s silly, and the acting is over the top, but it&apos;s fun. The story is simple with ten teens throwing a party in a demon infested mortuary. Quigley was so funny. I wasn&apos;t at all sorry for most of the people who died. There were so annoying, that&apos;s the whole point of this film to get a few scares, have fun, and see some alright nudity.",
