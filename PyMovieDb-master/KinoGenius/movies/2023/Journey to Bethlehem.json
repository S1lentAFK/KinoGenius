    "reviewBody": "Journey to Bethlehem is a good movie with the story of the old times when it was the beginning of Jesus whom I believe is not the song of god rather our prophet ( as a muislem )\n\nAntonio Banderas played Herod in this movie whose the king that Loves to be king his acting and his character and his song and his voice and the clothing and everything was made really well for Antonio Banderas&apos;s character and I really liked him I actually like him in every movie he&apos;s ever been and Journey to Bethlehem is the newest addition to Antonio&apos;s great movies\n\nThe Set design here is very good some scenes are really good and the Soundtrack is good too\n\nThere were some funny moments too ! The three kings that wanted to help Herod are amazing too especially that guy his voice is very soothing and he would make a great villain in any movie idk but he has a good voice\n\nOverall a good movie 7/10 it&apos;s good Antonio Banderas carried the movie for me.",
