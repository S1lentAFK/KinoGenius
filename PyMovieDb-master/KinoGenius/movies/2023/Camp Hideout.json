    "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t watch this. This absolute mess is boring and the complete opposite of funny. It&apos;s filled with cringe and embarrassing fourth wall breaks, unfunny remarks, and a very thin plot, if it even had one. Its a shameless rip off of home alone but a summer camp version. None of the story makes sense and its very confusing. I have no idea what on earth Christopher Lloyd was thinking when he decided to star in this film. He must have regretted it. Don&apos;t watch this movie in the theaters, Don&apos;t ever watch this movie. Not even when it becomes free on streaming. Just stay at least 10 feet away from this movie. You will thank me.",
