    "reviewBody": "The acting is superb and particularly Carey Mulligan who is astonishing, as usual, and Bradley Cooper&apos;s transformation is incredible. The look and feel throughout is very polished. But, and this isn&apos;t a minor quibble -- I found it really hard to understand the dialogue! Characters speak so quickly, in a mumble, that I actually considered putting on subtitles. Anyway, it wouldn&apos;t have made a difference, I thought the movie was so empty and plotless and uninteresting. There was really no tension in the wife&apos;s dealing with her husband&apos;s bisexuality, no real exploration or understanding of Bernstein&apos;s conflicts, and no delving into his achievements or their context, so there wasn&apos;t much left!",
