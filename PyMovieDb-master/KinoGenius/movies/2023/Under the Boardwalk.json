    "reviewBody": "So much better than I was expecting. My kid was watching it mesmerized for the whole film. So cute! It looks so good, and moves so well. Very Premium. Well worth adding to the repeat viewing list for the whole family. Great animation, characters, unique setting. Lots to come back for.\n\nThe arm scene was perhaps shocking, but I think they get away with it.\n\nI wish we&apos;d seen more about this sooner. It seems to have been overlooked by Paramount. But with any luck more people will see it on Paramount plus.\n\nGive this Director more fun stuff to make! Well done to the whole team. These days most animated films disappoint, but this one nailed it!",
