    "reviewBody": "This is not Magic Mike... that part of the story line is the pretext at this romantic Afroamerican comedy. The rhythm is good. No down time. Made my laugh out loud lots of times as much from the bad suggestive dance moves then from the flow of Afroamerican slang especially by women to describe sex, the male member or to insult one and other. Being a white single 60&apos;s French Canadian man... it seems to me that it was too much not to be stereotyping? But then again maybe not... As it was funny. And like it a good romantic comedy true love does blossom at the end... in a frenetic last scene. One scene toward the end seems to have needed more writing...",
