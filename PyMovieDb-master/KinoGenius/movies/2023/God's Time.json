    "reviewBody": "This is one of the best films i have seen this year. The story is fantastic im love the crazy stuff that happens in a day trope so much. The performances are great Ben Groh is amazing as Dev he is electric in this film and Liz Caribel Sierra is phenomenal as Regina her performance in this film is one of the reasons you should watch this film and Dion Costelloe is great as Luca he is fantastic in this film. The writing is so good. The cinematography is also very good it reminds me of the cinematography in Euphoria. This film is just so funny. Overall this was an amazing, hilarious, masterful, fun and entertaining film.",
