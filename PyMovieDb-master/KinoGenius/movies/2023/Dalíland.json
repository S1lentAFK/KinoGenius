    "reviewBody": "Events depicted in this film are real, this is not a sugar coated &apos;mummsy&apos; sentimental bio pic. Kingsley is Dali, Dali is Kingsley - a masterwork in observation of the legendary,tortured / mad / genius artist (delete as applicable) . Watch this and watch Dali at work and at play,, the great hedonist, the sad masturbator, the prodigious artist, a master of the photorealistic depiction of the seemingly mad, mad world that surrounded and stimulated his mind through his lifetime. A leader in surreal art a thoroughly likeable /unlikeable individual - like Marmite, you love him or hate him, but you can&apos;t fail not to notice Dali. And Ben Kingsley is superb in his depiction of him, , Sukowa too, as his muse Gala - both characters depicted, are so real, you almost want to be part of their bizarre swinging 60s/70s/80&apos;s coterie, they are vile and wonderful all at the same time.they depict the true meaning of what it takes to be an acolyte of Salvador Dali / Avida Dollars (Look it up) Its good to see Kingsley actually acting well for a change, I was in despair at viewing - the last ten or so of his films, have for me, been lamentable experiences - thank you Mr Kingsley for bringing Dali back to life and I hope reviving your career on an &apos;end note&apos; as a great actor.",
