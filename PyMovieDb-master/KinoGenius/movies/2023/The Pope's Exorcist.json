    "reviewBody": "Like clockwork we have at least 2 possession films each year around the same time. Easter and Halloween it seems. They&apos;re usually hit or miss with the same cliches strewn about with maybe some attempts at being slightly innovative. While this doesn&apos;t break away too much from the plot formula, Crowe&apos;s powerhouse performance does and amplifies the overall film to enticing levels. He has clearly found his late career niche with thrillers/horrors of late and it works extremely well. The scares are serviceable and the story is as well. Visually it&apos;s one of the best possession films I&apos;ve seen in quite sometime with fantastic settings and terrific practical and cgi features. This doesn&apos;t mean the cliches don&apos;t hinder it at times but overall a very welcome film for the genre.",
