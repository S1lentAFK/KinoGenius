    "reviewBody": "For a film of this scale, it is a good start for first time writer/director, truly an independent film with more of a commercial appeal for the Christmas season. The cast is lovely and delivers some delicious character work. And the signature song is amazing! It will surprise you. Take a watch with the family of different ages altogether! Independent films like this are challenging to get made, it takes great perseverance, multiple sacrifices and collaboration on all fronts. All for the sake of making entertainment for the whole family. The more family films are supported, the more will be seen in the future.",
