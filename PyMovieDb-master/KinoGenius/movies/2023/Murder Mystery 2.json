    "reviewBody": "I thought this movie was terrific fun. There are absolutely beautiful costumes, gorgeous scenery and entertaining laughs. It&apos;s not going to win an Oscar, but it was never designed to. It was designed to entertain and it is the perfect movie to watch on a Friday night with some takeaway. You will probably guess who the villain is pretty early on, but it doesn&apos;t detract from the enjoyment of the film. I&apos;ve never been a huge Adam Sandler fan, having said that I do find him quite entertaining in this role and Jennifer Aniston once again proves her comedic chops. Overall, it&apos;s a light-hearted and enjoyable comedy. Frankly, I can&apos;t wait for Murder Mystery 3.",
