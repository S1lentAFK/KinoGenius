    "reviewBody": "It was apparent that the production took inspiration from Wolf of Wallstreet and Bohemian Rhapsody. It wanted to show great musical moments from the highs and lows of a man&apos;s career; although a lot of it was taken out of context and not entirely true, and the cocaine infused chaos of the 70s but with a Party City wig.\n\nBad: Casting choices (that&apos;s the least convincing Gene Simmons I&apos;ve ever seen), Hair and wardrobe choices (I want to puke every time I see the pubes I mean chest hair from Neil), and the green screen and vfx.\n\nGood: The music is real good! Tayla Parx is a new discovery for me, has bits and pieces of fun though they fail to sustain it multiple times, Jason Derulo with a surprising performance.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can&apos;t fault a family wanting to honor a legendary family member but it would have been better had the creative direction been given to someone with experience. Just didn&apos;t seem worth the 10 years of pre production for this level of output.",
