    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s ironic that a movie with this title would get my lowest score ever! For a Christmas movie but that&apos;s exactly what this terrible, terrible movie deserves. We worry that artificial intelligence will ruin stories, but it seems as though this movie was written by clunky AI and directed by Monkey Bob (you&apos;ll know him if you watch the movie). So maybe it&apos;s a lesson for all of us that AI will never replace us. Or it&apos;s possible I&apos;m projecting because no actual humans should have signed off on this stinker. The movie tried to be way too many things: is Santa real?; rich vs poor; can Brandy still sing? It&apos;s a big no for me.",
