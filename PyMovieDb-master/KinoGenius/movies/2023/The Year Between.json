    "reviewBody": "A quirky tale about a girl with mental ilness, living at home with her family, basically going through the motions of dealing with all the highs and lows of everyday life.\n\nThe good: I love movies about misfits, people who dont belong, are out of place. This is such a story, and it starts out promising, because there is nothing more amusing to watch then someone behaving inappropiately ALL the time.\n\nThe bad: however, I was expecting a bit more drama and quite a bit more serious character development. Now the main character is stuck in a quirky stereotype.\n\nDefinitely not a bad movie, but somehow finally lacking in true drama.",
