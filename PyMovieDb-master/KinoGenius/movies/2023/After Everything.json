    "reviewBody": "While I agree that the last film in this collection was greatly disappointing, I must strongly disagree with those who thought Tessa&apos;s and Hardin&apos;s relationship was abusive or toxic. They are two young people who were damaged by childhood traumas and who are struggling to deal with the after effects. When they come together, they recognize each other&apos;s souls - whether they realize it or not. They just know that they are compelled to be together - despite all the odds against them. They spend years trying to learn how to heal and how to love unconditionally. I found the first four films to be truthful and powerful. I especially appreciated Hero Fiennes Tiffin&apos;s performance - it was a richly nuanced and profound portrayal of pain. I also understand Tessa&apos;s commitment to him despite the cycles of pain he thrusts her into. How? Because this was my life. And my Hardin just died - after we had spent 54 incredible, passionate, tumultuous years together. Those years of happiness were worth every moment of pain we ever had.",
