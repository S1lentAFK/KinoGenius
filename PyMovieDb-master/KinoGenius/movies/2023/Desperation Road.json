    "reviewBody": "2nd time actor turned director, Nadine Crocker did well to adapt this novel by the same name. The film flowed like reading a novel. Each character has proper introduction into the story, so audience have the understanding of who they were. The characters were clearly drawn and the actors had a field day expressing themselves and drawn the like of Mel Gibson to be casted in it.\n\nAll the main characters were essential in the story line, the regretful anti hero, the survivalist mother, go with the flow wise father, angry big brother, loving brotherly friend, and all the supporting casts had their moments. If this story done on stage, it would draw heavy character actors to join.\n\nDesperation Road is an underrated gem and a rare film. It&apos;s not an action flick, it&apos;s a life drama, very close to life drama. Things described in this film are true to life.",
