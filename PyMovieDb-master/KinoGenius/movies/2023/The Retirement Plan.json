    "reviewBody": "The Retirement Plan is directed by Tim Brown and stars Nicolas Cage, Ashley Greene, Ron Perlman, Jackie Earle Haley and Ernie Hudson.\n\nThis is the fourth Nicolas Cage movie of the year following The Old Way, Renfield and Sympathy For The Devil it&apos;s not his last either as he has A24&apos;s upcoming Dream Scenario (which has been getting great buzz from TIFF by the way) dropping in early November.\n\nUnfortunately The Retirement Plan isn&apos;t that good and it&apos;s mostly entirely carried by Nicolas Cage who never turns in a bad performance or phones any role in. Sadly this feels more like an excuse for the cast/ crew to take a mini vacation to the Cayman Islands for a week or two then for a good reason to even make this movie. It&apos;s fun and good enough for a one time watch but that&apos;s about it.",
