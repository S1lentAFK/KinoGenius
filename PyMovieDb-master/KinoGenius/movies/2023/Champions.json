    "reviewBody": "Despite mixed reviews, I absolutely loved this. What a delight. Woody is excellent in the lead and the film is frequently funny and charming.\n\nIt really shouldn&apos;t have been 2 hours in length and it won&apos;t be everyone&apos;s kind of humour, but it was a great cinema experience, with the entire audience laughing throughout.\n\nMaybe I&apos;m biased. As a huge NBA fan I liked all the basketball references and as a huge Always sunny fan, I loved seeing sweet Dee on the big screen.\n\nBut either way I think everyone should give this film a chance. This is a real crowd pleaser and one of my favourite films of 2023 so far.",
