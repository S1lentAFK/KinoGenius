We watched the steel ball bounce, and dance and ping and sway.\n\nThe Greyhound bus depot had a cafe and one pinball machine. We learned how to tilt, to cheat, and to love the game. Sorry for the cheating. Thank you for the winning.\n\nWe ate. Sometimes it was food, and other times it was sustenance. Mostly it was survival. Pinball gave us hope.\n\nCorn dogs.\n\nThe Future was ours, until it wasn&apos;t.\n\nAmen. God. Whatever. Pinball is alive and it lives within all of us. If you have a machine to sell, we&apos;ll buy it. May Be.",
