    "reviewBody": "There were times when they use to produce movies like Fight Club.\n\nNow they spend $24m to waste our time with some nonsense script.\n\nIt&apos;s not the first time for Oscar nominee Jesse Eisenberg to play an unlikeable, confused and soulless person, but what happened to Adrien Brody? Didn&apos;t he win an Oscar for the Pianist, at least that was 20 years ago ... I guess some actors don&apos;t read their scripts anymore before accepting their $400k roles.\n\nI usually watch the movies to the end to make up my mind but had to stop watching this one after 30 minutes since I could not relate to any of the characters in this movie.",
