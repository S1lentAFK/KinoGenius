    "reviewBody": "What do I mean by underproduced?\n\nThere is no overarching set of quality control for acting skills, special effects, and it makes the movie neigh unwatchable after awhile.\n\nWant to be an indie film? Hire hungry actors and go cheap on effects. Want to be a blockbuster? Hire A-listers and splurge on effects.\n\nThis film is jarringly uneven in quality and even though some of the newly faced actors seem to be bent to pour their hearts into their lines and action sequences, others obviously seem to be there just for the check.\n\nThis movie would have been better if it had been run a budget 1/10th the size with actors who actually wanted to do their jobs.",
