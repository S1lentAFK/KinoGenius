    "reviewBody": "I felt this was a mediocre movie. Some of the jump scares in the first half were pretty well done, but when the Boogeyman started to make a real appearance, the wheels came off for me.\n\nI think the acting was pretty good but there was nothing original or special in this movie. I feel that it&apos;s difficult to make a truly scary movie that sticks with you long after you&apos;ve left the theater; I was hoping The Boogeyman would stick to my bones a bit, but it did not.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking to kill some time with some jump scares, this is an okay flick. If you&apos;re looking for something truly frightening and engaging, I don&apos;t believe this is it.",
