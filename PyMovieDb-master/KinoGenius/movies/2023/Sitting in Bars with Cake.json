    "reviewBody": "Sitting In Bars With Cake\n\nBased on a cookbook of the same title, this is a tale of friendship, cakes and hospitals. Jane (played by Yara Shahidi) concocts a plan of bringing cakes into bars to distribute to patrons as a way of meeting new people, and potentially a lover. A hitch occurs when her best friend, Corrine, is diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nThe movie does a good job of showing the friendship at the core.\n\nYara Shahidi isn&apos;t a well-rounded actress, and it was very apparent in this movie. The inclusion of chuckles and laughs in most of her lines was irking. Odessa A&apos;zion as Corrine was a delight, and her shoulders deftly carried the weight of the duo. The supporting cast isn&apos;t very memorable but satisfactory.\n\nThere&apos;s nothing inherently amazing about Sitting In Bars With Cake, but the emotional core is enough for one-watch.\n\n5.5/10.",
