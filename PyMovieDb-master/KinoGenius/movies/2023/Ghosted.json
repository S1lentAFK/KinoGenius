    "reviewBody": "Let&apos;s be honest... I&apos;m a late middle-age guy, and Ana is stunning to watch. She could be making pancakes and I&apos;d spend $25 to watch it. She is warm and captivating and appears honest in her performance. Captain America is on point and fits the Bill as the farmer better than you would think. He&apos;s a much better actor than most of us think he is . Just go all the way back to sunshine directed by Danny Boyle (Trainspotting , Slumdog millionaire, etc, ) where he did very well over 15 years ago. Check it out if your fan of thriller horror from a phenomenal English Director.\n\nThis flick is good fluff, mostly family friendly, and a decent way to spend part of an evening. Its not grounded in anything remotely realistic ... but the leads are charming.",
