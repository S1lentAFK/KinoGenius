    "reviewBody": "Young Cady is given M3GAN, an AI doll, that&apos;s very protective.\n\nFirst off, I felt very old in the cinema, aged 40, where most of the viewers seemed to be teenagers, and I think they&apos;re perhaps the target audience.\n\nDefinitely not without appeal, it&apos;s an interesting, if unoriginal plot, Child&apos;s play vibes, and there are a few jumps here and there. M3GAN does have some intriguing moments, but sadly never flips into horror mode, which I felt the trailers pointed to.\n\nThe major plus, the visuals, it looks very good indeed, it&apos;s nicely shot and well produced, M3GAN&apos;s realisation is great, the film peaks towards the end, and the scenes in the forest in particular look very good, and offer the film&apos;s most unsettling moments.\n\nOn the debit side, it&apos;s hard to believe in the actions of some of the characters, a few times, I sat there wanting to shout out &apos;REALLY,&apos; is that actually what they&apos;re going to do, but worse, the film was a little too slow in parts.\n\nI expected it to be somewhat gruesome, it really wasn&apos;t, when I came home from the cinema, I read that it had been cut to fit with a younger audience, I can see that.\n\n6/10.",
