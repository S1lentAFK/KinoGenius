No.\n\nLet&apos;s take the movie for what it is: a light family movie you can totally enjoy during the period of Christmas.\n\nI watched the movie with my kids yesterday (10 and 8 years) and my wife.\n\nWe all enjoyed. The jokes are not always crazy good but good enough to make us laugh and have a good time.\n\nThe movie is obviously predictable but still, it did not bother me/us that much.\n\nI would still recommend to people with a young family. It&apos;s light, entertaining and as mentioned funny.\n\nEven for us as parents, there are some interesting messages (again, it&apos;s not deep but still, some nice reminders here and there that I enjoyed).\n\nGive it a shot unless light family comedies aren&apos;t your thing.",
