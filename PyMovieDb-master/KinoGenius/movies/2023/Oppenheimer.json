    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m still collecting my thoughts after experiencing this film, Cillian Murphy might as well start clearing a space on his mantle for the Best Actor Oscar.\n\nThis film is a masterclass in weaving narratives and different time periods while exploring the profound depths of a man whose actions altered the world&apos;s trajectory forever, for better or worse. Nolan brings us into the complexities of Oppenheimer, and all the moral conflicts stirring within him.\n\nMurphy&apos;s portrayal is so riveting that the long run-time became an afterthought. Robert Downey Jr also offers a great performance and Nolan&apos;s push and pull with how he uses sound design throughout is the cherry on top.\n\nSome viewers might need a brief refresher on WWII and Cold War history, but any film lover should be happy to willingly lose themselves in this film for hours on end.",
