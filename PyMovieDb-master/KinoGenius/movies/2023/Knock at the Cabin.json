    "reviewBody": "Parents Eric and Andrew take their young daughter Wen on a vacation to a remote cabin.\n\nM Night Shyalaman always manages to offer something a little bit different, sometimes it works, sometime it doesn&apos;t, Knock at The Cabin I&apos;d place as one of the better ones, I enjoyed it.\n\nI expected something along the same lines as Strangers, some sort of slasher movie, I wasn&apos;t expecting a horror thriller with biblical overtones.\n\nI&apos;ll be honest, I didn&apos;t care a great deal for it when I first saw it at The Cinema, but second time round, I rather enjoyed it, possibly because.i knew what I was expecting.\n\nIt&apos;s a truly quirky film, pretty much as you&apos;d expect, it&apos;s fairly well paced, has a degree of tension, it just manages to be so different.\n\nI always like to think about how I&apos;d feel in the position of a film&apos;s central character, and seeing if from Eric&apos;s point of view, you&apos;d surely be thinking it was a set up, and that someone from the past had set up an elaborate hoax, the alternative is too terrible even to contemplate.\n\nIt&apos;s well acted all round, but I have to give credit to Dave Bautista, who puts in an absolutely terrific performance, he&apos;s captivating.\n\nThose BBC news articles made me chuckle, most presenters now have regional accents across the channel, here they all had those wonderful accents from the 1950&apos;s, all terribly posh.\n\nThis film is definitely worth seeing, even if you were a bit undecided first time round.",
