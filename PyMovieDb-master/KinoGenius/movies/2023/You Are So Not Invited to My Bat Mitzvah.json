    "reviewBody": "All the best parts and any attempts at humor are in the trailer, so don&apos;t expect to see anything more that may make you laugh throughout the bloated and predictable 103 min runtime. The story was targeted to a younger teen audience and will mostly be relatable to those that understand the culture and religion of this film&apos;s theme. As a whole, the story is rather cliched and bland, and something that&apos;s been done many times before, and much better, with the only difference being the cultural theme. There are many better coming of age stories and funnier ones too. Adam Sandler&apos;s daughters gave a better performance than he did, as it felt Adam had better places to be at instead of this film. It&apos;s probably one of his most bland, underwhelming and amateurish performances I&apos;ve seen him in. I&apos;m baffled by the high Tomatometer rating, as this film at best is a generous 6/10 from me.",
