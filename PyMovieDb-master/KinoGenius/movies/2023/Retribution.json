    "reviewBody": "When I walked out of the theater I almost felt... empty... but I don&apos;t wanna say that the movie is bad, but... then again, I don&apos;t wanna say the movie is good either. It&apos;s your standard Liam Neeson thriller (with a little less action), but has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Luckily, the movie is only an hour and a half long, so it&apos;s not excruciatingly long. The main twist of the movie was sort of surprising, but at the same time made sense in the grand scheme of things, so I guess it could be considered &apos;predictable&apos; depending on who you ask. I guess at this point I&apos;ll just throw it smack dab in the middle. As a I wrote before, not good, not bad. 5/10.",
