    "reviewBody": "As someone who grew up with the original, I pretty much watch all of these whether I want to or not. I will say this was wasn&apos;t as cheesy as the last few have been. It just always cracks me up when a character gets stabbed on their side and in the stomach and don&apos;t have to go to the hospital or anything.\n\nThe killer was a cool twist. I had guessed it partially but was actually thrown off with the entire reveal of it, so that was cool, and the entire cast was enjoyable.\n\nIt&apos;s a decent movie, but I do hope they actually stop after this one. The same plot pretty much every movie tends to get a little boring.",
