    "reviewBody": "Highly disappointed with this movie. I don&apos;t know if I had too high of an expectation but the movie was a huge let down.\n\nActing was mediocre(except for Mr Grant), action was meaningless and dumb most of the time, comedic relief was slow and far between.\n\nThe story itself is really what drags this movie down tho, the premise is bad, unimaginative and full of plotholes. The scenario seems rushed, the dialog is abysmal and one liners are abundant and unfunny.\n\nFilmography is ok-ish, there are a couple of good scenes, but most is outlandish but not in a good way.\n\nAll in all, this movie(franchise if they get away with it) is sadly just a huge cash grab with no real essence.\n\nIf it wasn&apos;t a Guy Ritchie nobody would even know it exists.",
