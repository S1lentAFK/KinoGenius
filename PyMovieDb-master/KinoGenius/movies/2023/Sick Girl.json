The movie deals with cancer, friendship and growing up but is mostly lighthearted.\n\nNina Dobrev does a great job, the supporting cast is solid, no bad acting from anyone. Good chemistry.\n\nCopy pasting because character limit\n\nThere is couple of laugh out loud moments and there is a lot of the cringe style comedy moments.
