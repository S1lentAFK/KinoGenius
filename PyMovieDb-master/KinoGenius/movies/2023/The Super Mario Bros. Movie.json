    "reviewBody": "Some people are taking this movie too seriously. This movie is just supposed to be fun and colorful and not to be taken like a tarantino movie or something. Of course the plot could be improved a bit here and there but it&apos;s actually a really fun and entertaining movie when you just enjoy the ride. If you&apos;re a big fan of Mario you will absolutely love this movie 100%. I felt like a little kid again when i saw all the characters and easter eggs in every scene. The animation was insanely well done and i believe they could&apos;ve made the movie a bit longer to expand on the world a bit more and get to know each character more but that&apos;s about it.",
