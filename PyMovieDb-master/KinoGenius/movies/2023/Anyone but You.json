    "reviewBody": "We&apos;ve seen a million movies set at weddings before - where even the couple getting married gets invested in the main couples status. So I knew a lot of the tropes would be the same, but it was the same but a bit worse. The main couple story I actually really liked, I thought they were hilarious and cute and beat out other movies with the same storyline. It was everything else that fell short. The background characters felt cheesy and fake. All surface level gags or you didn&apos;t really get to know them, nothing felt genuine - case in point Bea&apos;s parents were incredibly unrealistic, no ones that out of touch. Even Bea&apos;s background felt half-done, never explaining why she didn&apos;t want law school.",
