    "reviewBody": "This packed an emotional wallop.\n\nIt had old favorites and new & equally memorable additions and was powered by an awesome sound track and the exchanges and dialogues full of fresh wit.\n\nIt had an eclectic group of friends, trying to save one of them. It had a heart- rending back story.\n\nIt had a meaner villain than almost every other Marvel studio film, since the Endgame.\n\nIt did not have a pack of super heroes confronting the next existential threat for all of mankind.\n\nIt is an almost perfect sendoff to the guardians. It is a James Gunn signature creation, with his creative imprint on the the look, feel and hear of every frame.\n\nI had postponed seeing this until now as every other Marvel film, except the second Black Panther, seemed to be derivative of every other film with only minor tweaks.\n\nThis easily tops ALL of them, by some distance. LOVED IT.",
