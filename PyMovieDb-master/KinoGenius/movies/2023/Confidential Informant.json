    "reviewBody": "Forget about the poster, thinking that this might be another great Mel Gibson dirty cop movie. NOT. Mel Gibson is only starring in this movie for a few lousy minutes, that&apos;s all.\n\nThe bad: the rest of this movie is filled with C-listed actors, who usually only star in television series and the sorts. This is a new low for Mel Gibson. Why did he have to choose such an inferior movie to star in? Is he running on lower ground? I hope not.\n\nMore bad: this movie has NOTHING going for it. It&apos;s terribly amateurish. Incredibly cheap looking. But most important of all, there is ZERO thrill or suspense.\n\nLet&apos;s forget this was ever made and I hope Mel Gibson gets offered some better roles next time...",
