    "reviewBody": "History is an undesired guest taking the backseat in Mr Scott&apos;s sprawling epic on Napoleon&apos;s life.\n\nMr Scott&apos;s craftsmanship is such that it&apos;s undoubtedly able to offer the viewer some unique experiences. But stunning battle visuals and great performances by the lead actors don&apos;t make up for gross historical approximation.\n\nI have no doubt whatsoever that Mr Scott knows his history and, if he didn&apos;t, he surely has a fat staff of assistants to tell it to him; so what he does here (as he did already in Gladiator) is a very deliberate and blatant choice to bend historical reality to the purposes of his own art, which looks like an act of unforgivable artistic hubris.",
