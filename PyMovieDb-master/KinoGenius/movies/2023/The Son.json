    "reviewBody": "As someone who read the book days before seeing this film, I can tell you it should&apos;ve been in two parts. I did thoroughly enjoy it! However, there are so many things that they left out that I felt were integral to the story. In order to properly see Snow for who he is-a spineless boy who only does things that look good to others-I think they needed to spend more time with the character. I&apos;m not usually a fan of two parters, but this one really should&apos;ve been. The characters fell flat to me because we didn&apos;t get great looks into them.\n\nMy boyfriend, who didn&apos;t read the book, really liked it and said he felt he understood the characters well enough though. So maybe it&apos;s just a me problem.\n\nBecause so much of the book is Snow&apos;s internal monologue, I know it would&apos;ve been hard to capture that properly on film, but I think they could&apos;ve. Also, it&apos;s SO much darker in the book, and I think that was necessary for the audience to see.",
