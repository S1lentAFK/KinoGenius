    "reviewBody": "Had I not paid to rent this movie I would have been out after 15 minutes. I finished it hoping it would redeem itself, it did not. Weird sexual images and references. Definitely not family friendly. Frankly, I&apos;d be a little nervous about these film makers working with young girls again. The story had no obvious theme. The acting was not very good, but that could be because the characters had no relatable qualities. Their motivations were unclear and I just couldn&apos;t buy into any of them; except maybe the kid Daniella. I don&apos;t know how they got funding for this movie. It was obviously expensive to make, but what a waste.",
