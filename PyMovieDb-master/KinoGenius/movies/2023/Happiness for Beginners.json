    "reviewBody": "Making an interesting rom-com is hard, simply because of how familiar the subject is. Happiness for Beginners doesn&apos;t really break new ground, but it&apos;s a lighthearted watch that manages to keep you interested. The characters are grounded and realistic, each with their own quirks. The leads keep you absorbed in the story. The side-characters bring their own unique perspectives and motivations. The romance grows slowly and organically, and never feels forced into the narrative. The visuals of the Appalachian trail are beautiful. All of this is done with a light touch that makes the movie easy to watch, and the overall result is something sweet that I think I&apos;ll be coming back to.",
