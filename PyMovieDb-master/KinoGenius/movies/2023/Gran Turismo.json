    "reviewBody": "Well, I love the game, so I knew I was going to go watched it, and it&apos;s really good if you are a fan of the game. The idea that you can make playing Gran Turismo so real that you would get recruited to drive an actual race car like it was your PlayStation is a Gamer&apos;s fantasy and it comes alive in a movie that&apos;s not a fantasy but a legit true story.\n\nGran Turismo has got everything you need dramatically for a sports movie. The Trailers leading up to this film don&apos;t do it justice. It&apos;s got far more heart to it as it unfolds an amazing underdog story.\n\nLike the game it&apos;s based on it showcase every aspect of racing but now with a more personal touch.\n\nIt&apos;s no Need for Speed but it&apos;s one of the best games adapted to a movie ever.",
