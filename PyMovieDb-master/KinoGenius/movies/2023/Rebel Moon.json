    "reviewBody": "Greetings from the other side.\n\nThe visuals in this movie are just awesome, but it&apos;s lacking substance. First, I&apos;m sick of the 100 pound women taking on a bunch of 240 pound men and winning. Nobody has ever bought this crap, and it takes you out of the movie. Try letting the women use her brain to out think these bad guys instead.\n\nIt&apos;s hard to judge this movie on it&apos;s own because it&apos;s basically a women zipping around the galaxy putting together a team to fight the bad guys. We get to know each recruit a little bit as they are approached by the woman.\n\nSo, this movie is watchable for the special effects, but not much else. It&apos;s basically an introduction of all the characters and a basic background of the woman&apos;s story. It doesn&apos;t offer much by itself. They should have made this a 3.5 or 4 hour movie and included part 2.\n\nAnyway, it&apos;s still watchable but by itself, it&apos;s not very memorable. Part 2 will determine if this movie is good or not.",
