    "reviewBody": "The story was enough. It showed what we are capable of when we are hungry and determined. No excuses, no quitting-do your best and that is usually enough. The actors were believable and worked hard to be able to be on the boat-no faking it. Loved the camera work, showing perfectly the race from above. Great job!\n\nOur country has been through extreme difficult times. The depiction of The Great Depression proves to us how the spirit of unity and relentless work can help us overcome any situation. We need this spirit today, more than ever, as our country faces division and contempt for those that disagree with our position. The American eagle, our symbol of grace and strength, inspires me. That beautiful bird must have a right and a left wing to fly. Let&apos;s protect and respect our diversity and freedom of opinion, today and always.",
