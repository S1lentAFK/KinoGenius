    "reviewBody": "Hesitated between a 4-6 rating. Some stops of the film convey the gist of the story. Some are muddled, expected, and very na√Øve. Moore&apos;s pursuit of improving Kyle&apos;s life brushes off as a consequence to chasing off a romantic interest at some parts. Also, her performance is visibly dry at a lot of scenes. Glad to see how Finn has been shying away from Stranger Things shelter. However, his real-life personality has been shining through his acting since 2019 which requires a bit of improvement. A great performance from his end nonetheless. Maybe a bit of coherence to characters&apos; purpose would have been better.",
