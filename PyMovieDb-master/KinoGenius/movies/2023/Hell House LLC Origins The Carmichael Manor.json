    "reviewBody": "This movie serves as a prequel to the original Hell House LLC giving us a backstory leading up to the events at the Abaddon Hotel. I love how they went back and forth between what was happening with the 3 filmmakers at Carmichael Manor to what happened to the Carmichael family. I also really liked that this movie had the same eerie feeling of the original Hell House movie. Something the 3rd one was missing but the 2nd did an okay job of living up to. Stephen Cognetti is definitely a good horror movie director and I hope that this series isn&apos;t the last that we see of him and his story writing. The Hell House movies aren&apos;t as corny and stupid as a lot of hyped up horror movies these days and this one really lived up to my expectations and was worth the wait. I watched it alone in the dark which is the best way to watch horror movies and I can genuinely say, I had chills in a lot of scenes and the jump scares were very effective. 7/10 which is a very fair rating in my opinion.",
