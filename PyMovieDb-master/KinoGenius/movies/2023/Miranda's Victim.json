    "reviewBody": "This movie is not a dramatic detective story with lots of horrifying scenes as the dark gloomy poster suggests. It&apos;s not even about Miranda and his rights, completely undeserved honor for him to go down in history like that.\n\nBased on a true story, it dramatizes stoic bravery of a young woman who had to go through the unsympathetic and ritualistic court system where procedural mistakes and skillful lawyers playing chess with people&apos;s lives have more impact than actual confessions, on a slight chance of helping others avoid her destiny and being able to sleep at night.\n\nA decent movie on the topic that unfortunately never gets old. Were you really raped or actually asked for it. Are you damaged goods or a traumatized human being. Shouldn&apos;t you just keep on living like nothing happened instead of complicating your life. Would they believe you?",
