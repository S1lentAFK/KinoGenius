    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never really experienced anything like this in a movie theater. Next to me a grown man sobbed the entire way through. I heard sniffles throughout the entire theater. I had to put my popcorn on the ground because it felt inappropriate to eat popcorn while watching this movie. I even felt wrong laying down in my recliner chair, so I moved it in an upright position. This movie holds a great deal of gravity. It&apos;s heaviness is devastating, and if you let it, it could flip your world upside down. The whole point of the film is to flip your world, because unfortunately we merely go about life as if these atrocities aren&apos;t happening. This movie will try and wake you up to the sick reality of child trafficking. I reckon it will be successful. It&apos;s incredibly well done, has a fantastic compelling script, for having little budget on the actor scene, I&apos;d say it&apos;s performances were beyond excellent. Even had some real artistically beautiful shots.\n\nGreat film with an incredibly powerful message.\n\nSee this movie. Have your friends and family see this movie. Share it with all. Movies as important as this come once in a decade.\n\nLet it flip your world.\n\nLet it flip the world.",
