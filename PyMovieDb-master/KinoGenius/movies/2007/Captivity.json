    "reviewBody": "I liked the movie for what it is, a movie to pass the time on a rainy afternoon.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the story is not that great. And with an avalanche of similar themed movies recently, this one really needed to shine to stick its head out above the rest. Don&apos;t expect too much of it. One known actress doesn&apos;t make a good movie, so don&apos;t blame one person for the script etc. Still worth seeing if you&apos;re invited by someone else to see it.\\n\\nThe end of the movie could have been with a bit more suspense I thought.",
