    "reviewBody": "This movie was OK, probably the best thing I liked was the Perfect Christmas song in it. I&apos;d like to hear that song on the radio. In this movie, Queen Latiefa plays the narrator role: maybe an angel since she uses a little magic. She introduces the story of a song writer Benjamin, whom is trying to get a dead with record star Jizzy. To make money in the mean time, he is a mall Santa. Next comes Jizzy&apos;s ex wife, Nancy, and her kids. The kids tell Santa, aka Ben, that their mom needs a complement. So, Ben takes it on himself to find a way to introduce himself. Nancy tries to track him down and two meet again and start dating. Nancy&apos;s oldest son John John dislikes Ben and plays pranks; however, Ben knows about them in advance because the other kids tell Santa what&apos;s going down. Eventually, Ben gets a call from Jizzy about liking the song he wrote and then he finds out Nancy is his ex, which leads to complications. But being a kid film, you know it will work out in the end.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: Kids will probably enjoy this more. There&apos;s just not much to the plot.",
