    "heading": "Soap Opera fantasy/spoof - typical John Candy comedy but not his best",
    "reviewBody": "Slightly along the lines of My Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter but the other way around and with fantasy rather than contrivance, with similar comedy and cheesy soap opera acting/story lines. It's silly, ridiculous but typical of soap opera shenanigans and it's quite a good spoof in that regard. John Candy is typical John Candy and everyone else is over-the-top, including Robert Wagner as himself and Raymond Burr in a comedic role, and Jerry Orbach too! \n\nDelirious is a crazy romp set in a fantasy town created by a lovesick soap opera scriptwriter. In a concussion-induced delirium Jack Gable (Candy) thinks he's inside his own soap opera and uses his writing to make himself into a dashing hero. It's Hollywood schmaltz but rather enjoyable and good for silly giggles. Lots of silly stunts (pretty impressive horsemanship) but shockingly bad sound/dubbing and there's lots of holes in the production. Overall a nice rainy afternoon watch. Wouldn't recommend it or necessarily watch it again although I really like John Candy, however, this was by no means Uncle Buck.",
