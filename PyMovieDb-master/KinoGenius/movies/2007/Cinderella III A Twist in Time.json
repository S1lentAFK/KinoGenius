    "reviewBody": "I have to admit that before watching this one with my 2 year old daughter, it seemed virtually certain that I&apos;d be doing a great deal of groaning and yawning for the next hour and fifteen minutes. After all, a movie made for young girls, released straight to video, and branded with a 3 at the end of the title, doesn&apos;t really sound all that thrilling.\\n\\nFortunately, I was pleasantly surprised! The artwork, score, and voice acting were all up to Disney&apos;s usual high standards. But I was most impressed with the writing / screenplay. Where the original Cinderella was and always will be a classic, I felt it lacked character depth. It was a wonderful movie in its day.\\n\\nC3&apos;s characters had real world problems and values. The plot was a great twist on the original. This one&apos;s a great little flick for any child or child at heart. I was surprised to see even my little 2 year old got emotionally involved in the story and stayed with it almost all the way through! At the end, I felt slightly disappointed that it wasn&apos;t released in theaters.",
