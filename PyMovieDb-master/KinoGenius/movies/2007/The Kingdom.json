    "reviewBody": "I didn't expect much - the story sounded intriguing but more than often the execution is lacking.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. This one pulled me right in. It's a very well rounded film, impressive actors, great storytelling, amazing pictures / camera work and very catchy music. It really felt like I was part of the story.\n\nIs this the best film I've ever seen? Probably not. But it is a great production and I had an exciting evening with a lot of emotions. We even talked about it for quite a while afterwards.\n\nIt's very nice to see european film productions on that level. I hope it'll hit the streaming services some day soon.",
