    "reviewBody": "When I picked this movie up I thought it was just going to be exactly like all these new children&apos;s movies coming out where they focus on stupid stuff like overrated sarcasm and farting, but it was actually a good little film. This movie was entertaining and I thought that there was some stuff that could be changed about it, but I still cut some slack to all kid&apos;s movies, because they are meant for kids and they sometimes make stuff in the movie unbelievable. Anyway, this is a nice kid&apos;s film and from my point of view, when I got through watching it I thought of it more as something an adult could be entertained by rather than a kid, because there were some parts where it would have gotten boring to the kid watching or even kind of scary the kid watching! So, I think this is one of the best new kid&apos;s films that has been released so far and I think you should see it for yourself if you don&apos;t believe me because it&apos;s harmless, charming fun.",
