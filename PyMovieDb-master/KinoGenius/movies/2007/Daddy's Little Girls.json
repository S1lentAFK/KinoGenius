    "reviewBody": "I guess I am one of the biggest dopes in this country, but I love Daddy's Little Girls. I have seen it three times already. I loved Gabrielle Union and she played the part well. Idris Elba was good too! I liked the fact that Tyler Perry omitted the Madea character this time, nice change. I enjoyed seeing familiar faces in this movie, which added a nice touch. I cannot complain Mr. Perry did a pretty good job and I am looking forward seeing another movie or play. My money was well spent and I don't feel guilty. If you are in the mood for a little drama, comedy and romance, then this is the movie to see. I guarantee you will enjoy it.",
