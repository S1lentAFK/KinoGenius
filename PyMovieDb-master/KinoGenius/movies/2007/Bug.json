    "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this movie. Judd was great in representing the suffering of her mental stresses. Shannon also delivers great support and drive, in their madness.\n\nAs the movie goes the insanity just keeps climbing and so do the performances.\n\nI think if you disconnect from the movie and develop an 'as if' attitude you will hate it, however if you buy in, you will connect with the paranoia and have a pretty entertaining if not an itchy time!\n\nGet them off, GET THEM OFF!!!\n\nHaha good fun film",
