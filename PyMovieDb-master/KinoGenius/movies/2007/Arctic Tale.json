    "reviewBody": "National Geographic does a documentary with a good dose of cutesy storytelling from the Queen Latifah narration. It starts with a momma polar bear and her two cubs emerging from their den for the first time. They have to navigate the new climate along side a baby walrus within its herd. It&apos;s nothing new to tell a nature story from a humanistic manner. Sometimes, it works well like the death of the cub. Other times, it&apos;s rather too cute. On that note, I don&apos;t like Queen Latifah&apos;s narration. It may be old fashion but nature documentaries always sounds better British. I also don&apos;t like the music which has singing in it. When it gets to a fart fest, the show takes a giant step down. I appreciate the attempt at something new but most of this is rubbing me the wrong way.",
