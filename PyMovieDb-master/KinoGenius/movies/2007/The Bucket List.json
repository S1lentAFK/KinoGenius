    "reviewBody": "I must say that watching this film was certainly a joy I was told that this was a must-see and i wasn't disappointed.\n\nMorgan Freeman and jack Nicholson put on a great performance and made the film great.\n\nBesides this, i think that the storyline is certainly well-developed and had a strong hold on me.\n\nThe only downer i cold point out would be the depressing beginning but that's about it! The rest was lovely.\n\nI can guarantee that many elders will find this a warm-hearted flick to see.",
