    "reviewBody": "Long ago, when I was a middle class suburban teen, I had the dubious experience of spending most of a year around rich kids. A few of them were as rich as the family depicted in this film. This movie, more than any other I&apos;ve seen, nails the behavior of young super-wealthy kids like the characters portrayed by Chris Pine and Kristin Stewart. That intoxicating mix of being beautiful, athletic, active, charming, seductive, cocky, arrogant, witty, disarming, entitled, and in their souls, corrupted and corrupting, envious, narcissistic, self-absorbed, irrationally competitive, and pitiful. Of course this film depiction is exaggerated (but not incorrect) in its evil and violence, but it hits far more realistic notes than false ones. Uncannily so. This really is what young foks act like when they know there will be no negative consequences to them acting out their whims.\\n\\nOtherwise, this movie has something too many movies lack these days -- a smart story that&apos;s still engaging, seductive, funny, but still with a social message, that doesn&apos;t weigh you down with angst or excessive downerism, and that&apos;s well directed and acted, and easy to re-watch a few months later. Then a few months after that.",
