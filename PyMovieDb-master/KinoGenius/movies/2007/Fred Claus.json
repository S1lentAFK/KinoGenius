    "reviewBody": "I thought this movie was very funny. My sons were begging to go see it so on a whim we decided to take them tonight. Just got back home and the kids were so excited that they laughed about it all the way home. I also think the movie shows a lot about sibling rivalry and how over the years it can blow up and get worse without anyone really realizing that it is happening. There were a lot of funny moments and I noticed everyone in our packed theater was laughing in what seemed to me all the right areas. I think this movie also shows how childhood disappointments can have effects long into your future. Either way, it was a very entertaining way to spend 2 hours and I would see it again.",
