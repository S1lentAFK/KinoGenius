    "reviewBody": "Very good adaptation, went with my family and all ages were laughing.\n\nRupert Evveret plays 2 very different characters and succeeds well in both. \n\nColin Firth is a lovely as ever fitting into a role that suits him very well and a certain scene from a Jane Austin adaptation is resurrected.\n\nThe newcomers who make up the majority of the school children are superb, not only do they achieve in acting well beyond their years. They provided as much entertainment as the other more experienced cast members.\n\nThe most surprising cast member of them all was Russell Brand. I went into the film with a despise of the man and thinking he would ruin the film for me, but he was actually pretty good. \n\nIn all I found St Trinian's to be a good film and definitely one for teenage girls to watch, but don't worry if you get dragged along to I guarantee you'll leave laughing.\n\nDon't forget to listen the song in the credits!!!",
