    "reviewBody": "This game is quite alright, but before we start listing the pros, let's think about cons.\n\n\n* there's only one character available - the Predator - there's almost no story - aliens are weak - most of the gadgets are useless - it's very, very simple\n\n\nI think the main mistake of the developers was to try to make this game big. There are huge levels with wide open environments - and aliens just don't fit in. If you can spot one from a hundred meters, it's easy to shoot it, so where's the fright? The game should be set in a claustrophobic environment, that's for sure. Now it's not a horror - it's an action game, and because aliens are so easy to kill, the action is rather slow.\n\nSo what have we got instead of a great game? A good game. Graphics are really cool, music is alright, and it's fun to play as the Predator. His weapons, his vision modes - all of it is classic. Levels look very real, and if only they were smaller and not so empty... Well, it's still not bad. It just doesn't feel like an AVP game. It's a Predator game. I was expecting a little bit more.",
