    "reviewBody": "I find it quite odd that so many folks have slammed this fine film. A masterpiece, no. A hateful &apos;attack&apos; on Mormons, hardly. I know for a fact the LDS doctrine outlined in the film is what &apos;the church&apos; holds. Why is this historical film off limits, I don&apos;t get it. The actors all did a credible job and Terrance Stamp was wonderful.This is a true Hollywood story. It is based on a real event. The Mormons murdered those folks on the meadow. It is no indictment on every living member of the LDS than a film about the crusades impugns every Catholic.The ending was a little over the top but it was a fine love story. All in all I have seen few films bashed this terribly that were so very good.",
