    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen psychological thriller&apos;s that try to scare you more than melt your brain, this one I&apos;m proud to say does both. It&apos;s a very, very malicious and haunting thrill machine. I t brings the very essence of how horror and Psycho thriller&apos;s are suppose to be done, not with over the top gore and CGI, but with old school conventional means.\n\nSecret Window is as sinister as it is smart it rolls along at a very steady pace and brings more to the table than what was required. It shows you what the decent into madness and utter chaos looks like, it shows you the depth and moral ambiguities of a torn man who&apos;s lost everything. With that said you can examine the physic of the mind as it cracks under extreme and constant pressure and how your choices do affect who you help, or who you hurt. This film&apos;s pace and dark style is meant to reflect horror films of the 40&apos;s, 50&apos;s, 60&apos;s and early 70&apos;s before gore became cool but that makes this film such a joy to watch and study. And that makes it a great film, not a good film, a great film.\n\nJohnny Depp( who was fantastic here.) gives a very eccentric and brilliant performance as the conflicted writer Mort Rainey, John Turturro does exceptionally well as the sinister and vicious Shooter and he almost outclasses Depp in this film. Charles S. Dutton does well with the few scenes he&apos;s. But the main let down and I think the reason for this film&apos;s poor reviews from critics were the bland and very lame performances of Timothy Hutton( he won an Oscar he can do better than this.) and Maria Bello, they really lowered the caliber and class of this film and forced Depp to try harder to make them look good and make there time on screen with him good, but he succeeds and they fail. But Turturro and Depp hold up strong.\n\nSecret Window is a very Keene and captivating psychological/horror thriller that is surefire mind boggling entertainment and out of this world fun. This movie is great rainy day entertainment or any day entertainment for that matter it&apos;s just all around a fantastic and mind boggling film that makes you question the sanity of writers and the world they live in ( speaking as one myself.) it brings to question as the thoughts in our mind really our conscious or our selves just speaking out to right the wrongs doe against us It&apos;s a film that ask those questions and then you have to answer. All in all Secret Window was a sinister, malicious and thought provoking film that delivers a movie going experience like no other.",
