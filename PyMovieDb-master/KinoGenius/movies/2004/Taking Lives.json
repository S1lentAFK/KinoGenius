    "reviewBody": "This is an acceptable suspense movie full of intrigue , thrills , action , twists and turns . This film is made for Angelina Jolie , she is in each shot. She&apos;s beautiful, she plays rightly, she&apos;s wonderful .\n\nHowewer , the other main character Ethan Hawke is regularly played , his performance is overdone and warped.\n\nThe support cast is featured by French actors : Oliver Martinez who&apos;s doing a American curriculum . Furthermore, Tcheky Karyo also has a broad career American ,generally in secondary roles.\n\nHere is also Jean Hughes Anglade who only has French films , but giving a short acting , where he misinterprets a minor role.\n\nKiefer Sutherland, as always, plays a nasty ,wicked,and evil person. Will he be the killer? .\n\nThe picture is professionally directed by D.J. Caruso . He is a good craftsman whose films often have intense car crashes such as Disturbia (2007), and The Eagle eye (2008) and this Taking lives (2004) .\n\nRating : Acceptable, only for Jolie&apos;s fans.",
