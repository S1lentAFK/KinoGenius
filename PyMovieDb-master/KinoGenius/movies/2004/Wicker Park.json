    "reviewBody": "This movie was one of the most unique films i have seen in quite awhile. I really liked the way it was portrayed. It was a very good storyline, from the previews it almost seemed confusing but it wasn&apos;t confusing at all.\n\nThe scenery was excellent. It was a top notch performance on everyones part. It kept you guessing until you didn&apos;t know what to think. It was a thriller, yet had a comedic spark here and there with a twist of romance and a dazzle of drama. It was by far one of the movies that stick out this year that i&apos;ve seen. Josh Hartnett played his role so well, and the 2 females i wasn&apos;t really familiar with their work but they did a fantastic job as well as Mathew Lillard.",
