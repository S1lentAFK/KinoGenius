    "reviewBody": "I admit it. I saw this movie simply because I wanted to see something light and fluffy. I got what I wanted. \n\nYes, it&apos;s a chick flick. Yes, it&apos;s predictable. Yes, it has the typical Hollywood ending. But the film never said it was going to be anything but that, and that&apos;s why I liked it. No political agendas. No heavy drama and/or gut-wrenching scenes. In fact, there really wasn&apos;t anything in this film that was really negative. It was just a cute, fluffy little film that was intended to make you fill light-hearted when it was over. And for me, that is exactly what it did. \n\nRank: 8",
