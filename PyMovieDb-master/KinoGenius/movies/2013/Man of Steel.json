    "reviewBody": "So we are looking at essentially a remake of Superman (nothing wrong with that). So how does it compare? Favourably.\\n\\nThe original is perhaps a little softer, more romantic and more idyllic whereas the remake is darker, richer and a little more interesting.\\n\\n2 changes that worked for me, the origin part of the story on Krypton which is much more expansive (creating more of a universe feel, literally) and the extended character of Superman Senior. Brando was the quintessential sci-fi &apos;head in a bottle&apos; character using him to explain Supe&apos;s back story in the original, Crowe&apos;s character came full combat ready and I think it added well to the overall story.\\n\\nReally enjoyable effort that sits well as a representative of the DC universe :)",
