    "reviewBody": "This would be one of the worst movies ever made. It was a nice idea to be offensive. But they didn&apos;t a good job at all in it. At some parts in the movie I even wondered if they did a job at all coming up with it. It is more like randomly played bad jokes. There really is no level of humor at all throughout the full length of the movie. There was only one good thing about the movie. And that is that is has an end. If you want to watch this please try something else. You will never get those eighty minutes of your life back. Yes it really is that bad. The only reason that I did watch it was because I couldn&apos;t believe a movie could be that bad. And contain nothing funny at all. Greetings.",
