    "reviewBody": "I asked my wife for her opinion before watching this movie. She told me that as a teenager she used to read all the Judy Blume books, and that it's probably more a movie for a younger audience. I gave it a shot anyway, and to be honest I regret it. It's a boring movie, and yes it's clearly something a younger audience will like more than the average movie watcher. I already had my suspicions when I heard that irritating slow piano music between scenes, it's a typical thing for bad movies. It's almost a signature for lame movies. I won't say the acting was bad, just average, but the story is one of those where you will fight to stay awake. Not for me.",
