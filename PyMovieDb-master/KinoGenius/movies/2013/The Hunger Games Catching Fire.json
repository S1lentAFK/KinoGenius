    "reviewBody": "I understand the praise definitely not among a favorite movie like someone else but quite excellent! I always appreciate Donald Sutherland his performances are superb one of the best of his was in JFK. The directing in Catching Fire is far better than part 1, Francis Lawrence is great his craft! Generally I&apos;m not intrigued by the Hunger Games films they aren&apos;t really my cup of tea but I really like this one especially how shiny at the same it&apos;s dark too. One thing to appreciate is how these movies blossomed Jennifer Lawerence&apos;s career although Silver Lining&apos;s Playbook won her first major award. Great entertainment all around.",
