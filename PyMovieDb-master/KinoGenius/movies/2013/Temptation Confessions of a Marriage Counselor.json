    "reviewBody": "I actually liked this movie, I don&apos;t know why it has such bad reviews. I know a lot of people don&apos;t like Tyler perry. But he&apos;s not even in this movie. It&apos;s not a comedy at all, which is unlike Tyler perry. But I thoroughly enjoyed it.\\n\\nKim kardashian isn&apos;t as bad of an actress as you think she might be. I was expecting her to be awful, but it wasn&apos;t that bad. Obviously she shouldn&apos;t quit her day job but it was bearable nonetheless.\\n\\nThe story line was actually interesting, and I love movies with a twist. This movie pulled me in and played with my emotions. It made me ask myself questions and wonder what I would do if I were in the main characters shoes. I would totally watch this movie again!",
