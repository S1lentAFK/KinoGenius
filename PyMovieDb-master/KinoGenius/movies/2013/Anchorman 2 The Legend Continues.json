It has to to be said its one of my favorite ever comedies. \n\nBut seriously!? What did you expect, something completely different? No! I didn't! I didn't want something completely different. I wanted more Ron burgundy, and plenty more brick tamland, which is what we got. Personally loved the film and cant understand why anybody didn't enjoy the original wouldn't like it too (unless you seem to think a movie called Anchorman 2, yes thats 2, needed to be something completely new and off the wall). \n\nSometimes think people need to get there head out there arse and just watch a film for the pure entertainment purposes it was made for.\n\nRant over. 8/10.",
