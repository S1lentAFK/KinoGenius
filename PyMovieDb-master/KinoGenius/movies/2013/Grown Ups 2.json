    "reviewBody": "Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) has moved his family back home from LA. The guys Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James), Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock), and Marcus Higgins (David Spade) are back with the wives (Salma Hayek, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello) and kids. There is also a bunch of frat guys led from the neighboring college.\n\nI love the friendship between the guys. Losing Rob Schneider actually improves the relationships. I love the wives especially Salma Hayek. I even love the kids. However this movie is flooded with stupidity. Sometimes the stupidity can be funny, but most of it is just really really really stupid. I can understand the haters. I agree with a lot of the criticisms. I just like everybody's happy relationships just enough to barely recommend this movie.",
