    "reviewBody": "Whoever decided that blaring modern pop/ hip hop music into a story of the early 20's was a good idea needs their heads examined. It not only removes you completely from the story but jolts you so far out of it that you need a few minutes to try and refocus yourself back into the story. (and that's not a knock on this genre of music, it just has no place here..) \n\nAfter an hour, I could stand no more, the acting and story seemed great, but the soundtrack was too much to take.\n\nSo much great music was made during this time period that if used effectively could have elevated this story. Such a waste.",
