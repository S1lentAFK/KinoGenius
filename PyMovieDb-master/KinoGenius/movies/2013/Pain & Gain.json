    "reviewBody": "Considering there are now more than 75 reviews on the movie, I&apos;ll keep it brief.\\n\\nEmily Blunt, Chris Evans, Andy Garcia, Catherine O&apos;Hara and all the actors turn in strong performances. It&apos;s really their acting that made the story engaging and effective. Especially considering the big pharma genre of drama movies has been milked a lot lately. Blunt is a stand-out here, bringing emotion to every scene she&apos;s in.\\n\\nYou&apos;ll get high drama, a little suspense, a few laughs and feel a connection with at least one of the main characters. You will likely also feel some anger... and compassion for Emily Blunt&apos;s character and her daughter.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a bit longer than I felt it should&apos;ve been but it will keep you interested to see how it all comes to a head at the end. If you&apos;ve got a couple hours and are looking for a dramatic story about the corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, this movie is worth the watch. A move has to be almost life-changing for me to rate it 8, 9, or10, but in my book, this one is a solid 7.",
