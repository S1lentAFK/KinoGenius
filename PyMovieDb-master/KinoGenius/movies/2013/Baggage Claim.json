    "reviewBody": "I stumbled upon this movie one rainy evening on TV. There was not much to do so I gave it a chance- had zero expectations. Yes, at some moments it is cheesy but somehow it keeps you intrested. Its cute. The acting is actually pretty good so I'd say if you don't expect too much give it a chance",
