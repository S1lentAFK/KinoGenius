    "reviewBody": "I know this is a very famous movie worldwide so I was excited to find it on Disney Plus.\n\nTo be honest, the story was so-so but the characters and CG were amazing. I understand why every girl loves Elsa and Anna.\n\nAnd I miss the winter season and playing with snow. The scene Elsa's fiance changed his mind made me so crazy.\n\nAnyway, it was beautiful graphics and music. I'll watch that part 2 soon.",
