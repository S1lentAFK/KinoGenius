    "reviewBody": "So many ridiculous scenes happened in this movie. For example, this one guy was down then the other guy got a chance to have a shot at him but then he didn't do it. Then next thing you know the first guy somehow got an opportunity to get a shot at the other guy. This type of scenario happened probably 3 or 4 times again and again just ridiculous. Just do it already! Like come on.\n\nIn addition, the accent is really funny like many reviewers on here mentioned. The actor tried too hard and he seems to fail at it.\n\nWaste of 1hr 30mins seriously and I gave this movie a 5/10 rating since it has some suspense scenes to it.",
