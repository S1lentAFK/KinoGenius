    "reviewBody": "The To Do List was a pleasant surprise since I figured it would be a low budget teen flick...But,you might say it was a very funny female version of American Pie. \\n\\nI&apos;m also surprised at the modest rating on IMDb. The ensemble cast headed by Aubrey Plaza did a fine job in a fast moving, profanity laced raunch fest that still maintained a valid and interesting plot...a high school grad wanting to learn about what she had been sexually missing.\\n\\nShe was helped by Rachel Bilson, as sexy as ever without her goody goody TV doctor persona and SNL&apos;s Bill Hader.Quite honestly it&apos;s hard not to like this film despite its grossness in parts.\\n\\nIt would be natural to have a welcome sequel with Plaza&apos;a character as a college girl.",
