    "reviewBody": "RV: Resurrected Victims is a muddled, confused and unnecessarily odd film that picks up and drops plot points quicker than you can keep track off giving it the feel of a much longer film or series edited down into a brisk 90 something minutes.\n\nIt's in many ways a bad film while at the same time being in no way a bad film given how fully it embraces the ridiculous set up and convoluted story which feels like an afterthought once the big reveal has been showcased. As it races toward the finish line various elements are brought together but rarely gel in a way that you hope they will. Still, it's inventive and odd enough that you can overlook the issues and just embrace the absurdity of what is clearly intended as a franchise starter.",
