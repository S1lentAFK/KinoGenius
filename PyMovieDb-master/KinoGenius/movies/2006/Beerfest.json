    "reviewBody": "Let me start by saying that I loved Super Troopers. Club Dread on the other hand was not one of my favorites. So i was hoping that this would be better than Club Dread but I did not think it could even compare to Super Troopers. But was i wrong. This movie was absolutely hilarious.\n\nI just don't understand why people are giving it terrible reviews. It was the funniest movie I have seen in theatres in a long time(as well as Clerks II). I understand the lack of plot but who says lets go see Beerfest, it will probably be a great epic? I went to see people drink beer, get wasted and do stupid things and thats exactly what I got.\n\nI laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie, there was not a dull moment in the whole thing. And when the American team was competing against the other countries, I was cheering as if i was watching a real professional sport.\n\nSo, if you are looking for a good laugh and an all around good time go see Beerfest you will not be disappointed.",
