    "reviewBody": "The Sentinel is an average action thriller, the plot is extremely predictable with no surprises and derivative of other action movies that have come before it. However, it's an enjoyably average action thriller due to a fast pace and really good performances from Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland and enjoyable action.",
