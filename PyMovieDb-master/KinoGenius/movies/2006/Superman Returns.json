    "reviewBody": "I became curious enough to re-watch this movie after seeing Brandon Routh&apos;s performance as Ray Palmer/A.T.O.M. in Arrow, Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow. \\n\\nI feel that it is a highly underrated film and gets an unnecessary bad rap. Brandon Routh&apos;s portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman, I feel, is second only to Christopher Reeves, whom he does a great job of capturing. \\n\\nThe action scenes are top-notch and fun to watch. It even has one of the most brutal fight scenes in any Superman movie which could be a bit hard to watch. Yes, even more than the Zack Snyder movies.\\n\\nThis movie is far from perfect, but it is a lot better than what it&apos;s given credit for. I do recommend checking it out.",
