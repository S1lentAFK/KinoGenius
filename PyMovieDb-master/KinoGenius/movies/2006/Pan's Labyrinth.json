    "reviewBody": "I saw this at this years FrightFest Film Festival in London and absolutely loved it.\\n\\nGuillermo was there to introduce it and you can tell it really is a film he loves and is passionate about.\\n\\nHe referred to it as a sister movie to The Devils Backbone.\\n\\nAnyway . . . so the film starts and I must admit I was expecting a lot more of a fantasy film however it is more of a 70/30 split between historical era movie/fantasy fairytale.\\n\\nDon&apos;t let this put you off though, the film really is stunning and brilliantly acted. The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself! \\n\\nThe violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!\\n\\nGive it a go if you can get to a screening, DON&apos;T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!",
