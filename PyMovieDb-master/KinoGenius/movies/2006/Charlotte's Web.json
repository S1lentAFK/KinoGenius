    "reviewBody": "With this movie made in part in my hometown (Williamstown) I dragged the kids along to check it out.\n\nBeing well familiar with the story, I expected this to be pretty light hearted fair, but the wife still managed to turn into a blubbing mess at the end.\n\nThe movie had an uneasy feel about the setting; didn't feel current or old for that matter, so perhaps will age OK.\n\nThe CGI was pretty amazing. I'd hate to imagine what someone from a time capsule or straight out of jail would imagine has happened in our world since they left. Talking animals and spiders, so realistic the kids don't even blink twice.\n\nGood for young kids (mine are 4 and 2), and not monotonously boring like many of the other CGI laden kids movies out there.",
