    "reviewBody": "A horror comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously, and delivers scares and laughs in equal and effective measure, and serves as an affectionate homage to low budget B horror movies. Its over-the-top violence may be hard to watch, but its compelling performances, witty and clever script, stylish direction and stunning visual effects make for an entertaining and thrilling viewing experience.",
