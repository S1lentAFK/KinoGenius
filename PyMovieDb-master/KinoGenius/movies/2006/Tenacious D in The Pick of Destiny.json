    "reviewBody": "When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a movie about their band I was freaking out! I love their music and I hoped that this movie would be really funny! Now that I have watched it I can&apos;t really say that these hopes weren&apos;t satisfied but I think I expected more. The movie is full of Tenacious D&apos;s great music and I really loved listening to all of it. There are a lot of great jokes and I just love the story, at least the first bit. I don&apos;t like the way the movie ends. The ending is very abrupt and in my opinion they could have extended that a bit more.\\n\\nOverall I think it is a good movie to watch! Everyone who likes rock music should watch it! It&apos;ll give you a good laugh!",
