    "reviewBody": "I didn't expect that. This movie was actually funny in spite of how utterly silly it was. The weed jokes didn't work for me, but surprisingly the adult child in the form of J. P. the game designer (Joel David Moore) had me cracking up. Regularly adding to the laughs was Jeff (Nick Swardson), game tester and best friend to the main character, Alex (Allen Covert).\n\nAlex was a 36-year-old video game tester, pothead, dweller in the home of his grandma. To be fair, the grandma situation was temporary as he'd just been hilariously evicted from his house by his landlord Yuri (Rob Schneider). The movie wasn't deep nor did it have a real conflict until the last fifteen minutes, and even that was mild. It is a fun movie with sophmoric humor that will work with some and not with others. For some inexplicable reason I found it gut-busting.",
