    "reviewBody": "Was this a missed warning sign? The current climate in America is kind of portayed here. Though some would argue, that it doesn&apos;t depict all of America, not even just the one side who seems to have a glutton for punishment and seems to like to vote against their own interests. So while there is some relevance to current events, this go far out.\\n\\nStill if you feel uneasy watching this, it doesn&apos;t mean something is wrong with you. Quite the opposite is the case, everything is right with you. Quite ridiculous at times, it is there for entertainment purposes ... no really! They weren&apos;t trying to do a documentary! All kidding aside, this can be viewed as fun - no matter what your political background is.",
