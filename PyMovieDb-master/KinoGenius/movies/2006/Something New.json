    "reviewBody": "First off, this movie is NOT about a shortage of black men. In fact, there are plenty of black men in this movie: husbands, brothers, boyfriends, guys at Starbucks, club-goers. It just so happens that the main character Kenya, a black woman, falls in love with a white man. What&apos;s the big freakin deal?!?! To repeat, this movie is not about a shortage of black men; it never claims to be. It&apos;s a love story and one that is complicated by race. I thought the issues they had to deal with as a couple were very real, particularly Kenya&apos;s issues with her job.\\n\\nI can totally relate to the Kenya character and I can easily think of 10 other black women who probably can too. This film was refreshing; it was so nice to see a smart, successful black woman as the main character of a movie. GO SEE IT!",
