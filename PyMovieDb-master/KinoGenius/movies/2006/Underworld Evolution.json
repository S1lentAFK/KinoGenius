    "reviewBody": "Underworld evolution picks up right after the first movie and keeps the ball rolling. The storyline is well developed and the action is kept up throughout the movie. A successful sequel in that the action is suitable amped up from the first and the characters are further developed. Selene is a badass, and while Michael is a bit of a hapless dope it doesn't matter, Selene is the queen and always will be.",
