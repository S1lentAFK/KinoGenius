    "reviewBody": "Undoubtedly this sequel suffers from the absence of Dom and the Toretto clan, but it still makes for a very enjoyable ride.\\n\\nThe plot is a little bit derivative of the first, following Brian on an undercover op, but it is a pretty fun story nonetheless.\\n\\nWe get to meet new characters Tej and Roman, who grow to become franchise regulars, and their introductions are very solid.\\n\\nThe direction is fairly slick. Some of the awkward choppy camera shots and whiplash inducing cuts remain, but there&apos;s plenty of impressive camera work in here too.\\n\\nWhat I really enjoyed about this film though was the general tone. It is energetic and sleek and despite its flaws always carries a certain amount of charm and appeal.",
