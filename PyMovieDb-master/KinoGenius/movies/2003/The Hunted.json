    "reviewBody": "As a big fan of both Benecio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones, I might be slightly biased, but that&apos;s only because I really enjoy seeing them act. That said, there are in fact movies with BDT in them that I don&apos;t care for, and the same goes for TLJ, so obviously there&apos;s more to it than that here. To me, this movie pays homage to, or at least was clearly inspired by, the first Predator movie and in ways also US Marshals which starred TLJ in a similar role. But what I really loved about The Hunted was the polarity of the characters; the coldness of Del Toro, with a pinch of humanity at the beginning, and the civility of Jones, while being detached from the world and conscious of his deeds. Action wise the movie is a little scarce, though the war-like prologue wasn&apos;t without it, just a different kind of violence. The climax was satisfying, albeit a little drawn out even for my taste; it was the cat and mouse second act that kept me going.",
