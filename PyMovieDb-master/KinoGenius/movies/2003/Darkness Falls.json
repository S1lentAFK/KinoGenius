    "heading": "a cheesy slasher flick disguised as a horror film",
    "reviewBody": "The first 5 minutes started off scary with the boy in the dark, and the visit from the girl next door. The use of shadows made it creepy and when his mom is grabbed, that's really scary.\\n\\nBut, it goes down hill after that. An unique idea gets turned into a boring slasher flick. It's PG-13, and there isn't a lot of blood, so that takes a lot away. There were way too many plot holes. Like if Kyle knew he wasn't crazy, then why was he taking the anti-psychotics. And plus, it makes no sense that he was able to never spend any time in the dark for years. But, when he goes back to his hometown, he's put in all these situations with no light. And the theme, stay in the light, is so old. The writers went the easy way out since they couldn't come up with anything better. And how does Kyle look so kept together since he's been in a psych ward for years. Yet he looks like he stepped off the cover of GQ.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: Weak writing. No gore. Overall lame.",
