    "reviewBody": "This is an okay movie. And the visuals are nice. The virtual world is really polished. And the colorful costumes do make a break from the usual movie. The jokes are okay, but nothing special. And the children seem to have fun. But, boy, I had no idea Dr. Seus was a fundamentalist Christian poster boy. That would explain the poor box office results compared with worse movies.\\n\\nContact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",
