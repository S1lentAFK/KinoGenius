    "reviewBody": "This Stephen King adaptation is underrated, sure it has it&apos;s flaws, it&apos;s a mishmash of many things in some sense it fails to find it&apos;s bearings. But that is only in the surface, in all it&apos;s weirdness these is a sense. Hard to grasp and see at first, I revisited this movie almost a decade later.\\n\\nI didn&apos;t recall this movie to be anything impressive or mind-blowing. Yep upon a recent viewing I find my self pleasantly surprise by this flick. Dreamcatcher isn&apos;t Stephen King&apos;s best book by a long shot. The four main actors gave stellar performances, John Seale&apos;s cinematography is simply perfect for this. Damian Lewis is simply genius in his role.\\n\\nDo your self a favor, watch this movie, ignore the low rating.",
