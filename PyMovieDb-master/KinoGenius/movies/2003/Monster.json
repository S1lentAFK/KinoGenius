    "reviewBody": "I went into this movie with only an inkling of the plot because i enjoy kore-eda's films and was familiar with several of the actors. For a movie like this, the impact is greater if you don't know too many details and can reach your own conclusions without preconceived notions.\n\nThe story is constructed like a kaleidoscope. Just when you have pigeon holed people into a role, a quick twist presents a slightly different picture although the characters remain the same.\n\nI thought it was thought provoking, emotional, and beautifully acted. Kore-eda has a genius for finding amazing children who create such nuanced and natural performances at a young age.",
