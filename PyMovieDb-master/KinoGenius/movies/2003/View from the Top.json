    "reviewBody": "i liked the premise - small-town girl makes it big as an airline stewardess. the costuming and set design suggested this could be a hip, trend-setting movie. i love seeing women and men who seem different and invite curiosity, i like watching Gwyneth Paltrow acting out the sincerity in her character. but it sure seemed this script wasn't rewritten enough times - even redirected. most of the other characters were introduced as a little quirky or sexy, but after that they became uninteresting, the tension or romance between them didn't seem real. why introduce characters that never recur or mean anything in the end? why go to Paris or New York, and see it from the inside of a room? it's as if the budget was being cut as each page of the script was discovered to be unworkable material! by the end of the film, i felt sorry for most of stars who appeared in this. i think it could have been one of the funniest, interesting movies of the year - i would love to remake it as a real insight into the world of the airline stewardess.",
