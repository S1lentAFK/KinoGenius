    "reviewBody": "Basically Fast and Furious on motorcycles.\n\nI'm a motorcycle fan, I loved this movie, the bikes are really amazing, stunts, soundtrack and etc.\n\nOkay, the plot is very generic and predictable, but not every movie is required to have deep plots, sometimes you just need to entertain the audience, which this movie achieves. In addition, it's no masterpiece, but it's still a great movie, especially for those who like motorcycles like me.",
