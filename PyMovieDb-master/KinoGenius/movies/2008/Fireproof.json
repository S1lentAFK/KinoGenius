    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the movie. It hits on many core issues in a marriage, whether you are spiritual or not. Individuals who are not believers will not like it and should stay home if they are not receptive. Just as I do not attend science fiction films because I do not like that genre. \\n\\nActing was much better than Facing the Giants. Excellent use of humor. With regard to all-white cast as referred by another summary on this site, I am not sure if that person actually saw the movie given the following facts:\\n\\nThe first word spoken in the movie is by a black person. The wife has two black friends who she she sees quite often. The first person who brings up God to Caleb is his Lt., a black man. There is one other black person at the station who has several lines. \\n\\nI would hope that summaries be written by people who actually see the movie.",
