    "reviewBody": "Im sorry but the ratings people have given this film totally don&apos;t represent the true value of this film. Okay I bought this film not knowing what it was and for \\u00a33 it is one of the best DVD buys i have made. The story line is unique.... displaying the internet to be a dangerous murder weapon. And the acting is pretty good. \\n\\nThe fact the film does not feature an a-list celeb maybe puts the film down a bit in some peoples eyes. I think everyone would be buzzing if the bad guy was someone along the lines of Kevin spacey/John Malkovich. But thats been done before! People have to learn that a good film does not have to have the cast of oceans 11 to make it a great film.\\n\\nGive it a watch and tell me what you think...definitely deserves a higher rating!",
