    "reviewBody": "The movie itself...Not a classic, not very memorable, and very, I mean VERY unrealistic.\\n\\nStill, I say who cares? Some people take every issue so seriously. I was reading one reviewer who was whining about the screens on the computers in the movie that were on for probably a whole 30 seconds...huh? People take things way to seriously. As stated the movie itself isn&apos;t the best and the ending is kind of rushed, but it has some great actors(including the late David Carradine) and its a fun flick. So, If your like me and you don&apos;t care that someone&apos;s tie didn&apos;t match their shirt then check it out.\\n\\nI give it a 6 and It deserves no less then a 5",
