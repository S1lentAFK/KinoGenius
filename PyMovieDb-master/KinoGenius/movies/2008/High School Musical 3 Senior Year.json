    "reviewBody": "Because the rest of it is pretty forgetful, not to mention in High School Musical 1 and 2 it was an ensemble, but in the third time around, it is downsized to three of the main characters, Troy(Zak Effron), Gabriella(Vanessa Hudgens), and Sharpay(Ashley Tisdale). The rest, Chad(Corbin Bleau), and Ryan(Lucas Grabeel), I felt did not have much to work with, they where in and out for the most part.\\n\\nBut it did have amazing dance numbers and had great songs, like the first two did, but Effron, Hudgens, and Tisdale just keep repeating themselves. It's entertaining at times dragging. I'll bet the cast is ready to move on after this one, I could see it on most of there faces. It was alright, but not exciting and energetic has the first two.",
