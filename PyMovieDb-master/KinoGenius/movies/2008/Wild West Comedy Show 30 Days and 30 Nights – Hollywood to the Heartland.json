    "reviewBody": "It seems as though a lot of people were expecting a comedy show, as opposed to a documentary on a comedy show. Its a shame they have to pan the film for not dazzling them with humor, when it has so much more to offer. I find the filmmaker's choices and the honesty of those on camera riveting (i.e. insecurity, heckling, bad jokes, good jokes, grateful to ungracious and back again) Maybe I wouldn't have enjoyed the show in person (on an off night), but I truly enjoyed the evolution of the show from Vince's eyes. I want to make love to him. A similar film is THE COMEDIAN, being in show business I find the material incredibly compelling, those of you who like sports or Larry the Cable Guy obviously, it wouldn't be for you. Interestingly there were no women on the crew or in the show . . . hmmmmm",
