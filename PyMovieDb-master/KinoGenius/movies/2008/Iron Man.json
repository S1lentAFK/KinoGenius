    "reviewBody": "Fortunately, I&apos;m not one easily influenced by some users&apos; negative comments. These people should try to restrain their bias opinions and try to review the movies as neutrally as possible.\\n\\nNow I would say that this movie has slow but steady momentum-building. It is a movie for people who has never known Iron Man in the comic series. The characters are given names and personalities, true to their comic book counterparts.\\n\\nActing was among the best comic-turn movie I have seen so far. Effects were believable and not overwhelmingly CGI, except for the tank scene.\\n\\nThis movie, however, has sequel written all over it. We know that because there are many scenes that could have lead to more.\\n\\nIt&apos;s well worth its ticket price.",
