    "reviewBody": "This movie is a masterpiece. Like we have movies like Red Heat and Red Sonja (movies I actually love), but then you're treated to a different type of perfection. This movie is the very definition of perfection. You're hooked from the very first line of dialogue, and you're on a roller coaster from there on. And the Freebird scenes... Oh my god they're perfect. Some movies used that song incorrectly (The Devils Rejects, Kingsman, so on. This movie blurred the lines between fantasy and fiction. This movie will shed the eyes of many Americans, it's even more sad than Sophie's Choise and Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. Just magical. Like, there's art, them there's the 2008 Drama known only as Proud American. Just.. Watch this movie, absorb it's message, and sit quietly in a dark room and contemplate existence. It is that powerful. Highly recommended for any fan of thrash metal.",
