    "reviewBody": "The original 'Madagascar' was one of the funniest animated films I'd seen in a long time, characterised by witty humour, hilarious one-liners and some brilliantly funny characters. The sequel is unfortunately a downgrade, a cut-and-paste job that loses a lot of what made the first movie so good.\n\nThe plot in the sequel isn't as interesting, in fact there's not much of a 'plot' - not a lot happens. It did make me laugh on occasions, but no where near as much as the first film. 'Madagascar 2' is a decent enough sequel but it's not as witty and smart as the original.",
