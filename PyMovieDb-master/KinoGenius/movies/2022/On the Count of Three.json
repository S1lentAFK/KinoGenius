    "reviewBody": "On the Count of Three is a beautiful film about friendship, empathy, and mental health. The two main characters, Kevin and Val, are lifelong pals who would do literally anything for each other. These bosom buddies are currently at the end of their ropes and see no way out of their situations but to end their lives. Forming a suicide pact, they set out on a journey to savor their last day on Earth, embarking on adventures of a tragicomic nature. An oft-underrated actor, Christopher Abbott delivers a stellar performance worthy of accolades. Carmichael on the other hand proves himself as an adept director with a bright future ahead. One last note: Kudos to the person in charge of music! Truly aced it. Go Team Indie Movies!",
