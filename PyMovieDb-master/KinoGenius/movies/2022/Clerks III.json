    "reviewBody": "This is a film in three parts. The first reacquaints us with Quick Stop crowd and is quite funny although depressing that these guys haven&apos;t moved on at all in the last thirty years.\n\nThe second is a boring mid section that drags on while the two main characters make/ or remake the first Clerks movie.\n\nThe third is a well made emotional journey that, hopefully, says goodbye to the franchise forever.\n\nConsidering the awful Silent Bob and Jay movie as well, this whole set of characters are totally played out. Finished. Over-cooked.\n\nI hope that Kevin Smith now moves to something a little more original.",
