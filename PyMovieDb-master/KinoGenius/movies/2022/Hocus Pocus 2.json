    "heading": "This movie just shows that people can&apos;t do humor like they used to- this is comedy without the laughs",
    "reviewBody": "Not bad but super lackluster compared to the original!\n\nIt lacked sincerity and feeling. In fact, I didn&apos;t feel much of anything throughout except frustration. Whereas the first one made me laugh and cry the whole way through, this one was really ho-hum, except for the very end- and I only laughed once!\n\nLike I said, there is a feeling of insincerity to this one. It&apos;s basically a parody of itself, whereas the original feels like a genuine classic. And a lot of the stuff in this felt forced and just annoying.\n\nAlso, no Max, Dani, or Allison in this one, and I was really looking forward to their return!\n\nGlad I watched, but overall, a letdown and super lame.\n\nUPDATE: Okay, it&apos;s only lame in comparison to the original, but not lame overall. I just can&apos;t stay mad at a Hocus Pocus movie- anything with these 3 sisters is cool with me, and I hope there are more sequels!",
