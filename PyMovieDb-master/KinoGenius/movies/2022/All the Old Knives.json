    "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t come into this expecting nonstop action and thrills. What we have here is a ponderous, character-driven Cold War style espionage film that takes it time telling its intriguing story and has a satisfying payoff.\n\nI was happy that some of the twists have much more depth than at initial glance and feel more natural than a lot of shock value storytelling. Pine and Newton do most of the heavy lifting and fit their roles well. Pine gives off some serious elder Brosnan vibes here and I&apos;m here for it. The story ends up being quite heartfelt and bypasses most of the cliches that plague the genre.\n\nThe people complaining about how confusing it is clearly did not pay attention because every prior moment of intrigue is explained by the end.",
