    "reviewBody": "Despite Having 2 well know actors, I actually Really like, Dern and Lang! This was just SO MUCH SLOW and Stupid Garbage!!! I think these 2 seasoned actors either did someone a favor appearing in this, or were bored and just wanted something to do, Obviously Anything to do!!! Waste of their talents!!\n\nI gave it 2 points for the beautiful architecture of the Mid-century homes I am familiar with from my youth.\n\nBut, Such a BAD and Boring SCRIPT!!! Could have been a decent movie with a Better script and much better actors, because I didn&apos;t recognize anyone and they were so emotionless and making constant stupid horror clich√© choices! For a Doctor and Architect, I found the 2 leads (couple) to be Really lame! But I&apos;ll take that Thunderbird, Please!! ;D\n\nThe houses and 50&apos;s style clothing and beautiful cars is NOT a good enough reason to WASTE almost 2 hours of your life on this Tripe!! You&apos;ve been warned!",
