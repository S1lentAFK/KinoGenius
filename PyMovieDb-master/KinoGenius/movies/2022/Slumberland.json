    "reviewBody": "This is a very well made, perfectly balanced film.\n\nIt has enough confidence to take its time laying down the background and characters - yet doesn&apos;t drag.\n\nThe set pieces are imaginative and well rendered - younger children will be enthralled.\n\nThe production and acting is great! The cast is lean and all the characters are interesting and serve a purpose.\n\nThe writers used great skill replicating a dreamlike state by bending the rules of reality in fun ways - but managed not to take things too far and lose all sense of tension.\n\nThis is a remarkably well made film that is fun, exciting and touching.\n\nIt has amazing affects and great character moments.",
