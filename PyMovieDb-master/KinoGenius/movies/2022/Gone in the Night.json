    "reviewBody": "Gone in the Night is a mildly intriguing movie with an interesting story. It&apos;s helped by non-linear story-telling. I didn&apos;t hate watching it. It&apos;s not a terrible choice if you really have nothing else to watch.\n\nWhy didn&apos;t I like it more? I don&apos;t really know. I just wasn&apos;t that engaged. I could tell it was more of a streaming-level movie. I looked up that it had a limited theatrical release, but it&apos;s not theater-worthy in my eyes.\n\nI also found the story to be mostly predictable. Maybe I watch too many movies. I think others will enjoy this much more if they don&apos;t see everything coming. But you&apos;re probably better off rewatching a great movie instead. (1 viewing, 4/8/2023)",
