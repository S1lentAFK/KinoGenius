    "reviewBody": "Why Mel Gibson took part in this film at all is beyond me. The movie has a lot of flaws and is bad. I laughed several times when I shouldn&apos;t have, and when I should have, I didn&apos;t. That says a lot. It&apos;s a shame because the movie could have been much, much better, it has potential considering the plot.",
