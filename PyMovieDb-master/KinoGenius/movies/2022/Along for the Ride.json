    "reviewBody": "I definitely agree with the majority of reviewers who are giving this between a 6 and a 7. The storyline had the potential to be so much more but in general it, and the actors. Always fell a little flat to me. I gave it a 7 because I managed to get through it until the end, but I was never moved in the way I would like to be when watching a movie, and honestly, I could have just as easily given in a 6. So much could have been developed more - family dynamics, relationships, friendships. In short, watch this if you have nothing else to watch and you will probably feel a bit meh throughout. It was entirely surface and superficial.",
