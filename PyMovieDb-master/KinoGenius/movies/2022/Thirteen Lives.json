    "reviewBody": "I am Thai and I went through that time with my eyes glued to news channels and reports. Knowing the outcome doesn&apos;t effect the experience much at all. That&apos;s how good they made this movie. All the details, the sacrifices, the volunteering and the effort portrayed in this movie was just superb. Ron Howard&apos;s Apollo 13 comes to mind. We all knew the outcome but damn were we still on the edge of our seats.",
