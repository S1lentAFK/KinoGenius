    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a disabled Latina and I grew up with a very aggressive mother who had to fight for most of my rights. Because of this, I&apos;m extremely turned off by these personality types. Despite my disability and my minority status as a Latina, I fully admit I have a problem taking up space, something Lopez has NO problem doing. Unfortunately for someone like me, it&apos;s extremely unflattering for me to watch a documentary of a personality type like this. While most people are praising her perseverance, I just heard whine after whine after whine of a very privileged person. You can&apos;t argue Lopez isn&apos;t a hard worker. She&apos;s one of my favorite actresses but her singing and dancing leave something to be desired. Maybe she should stop whining about the oscar nomination she didn&apos;t get (that she didn&apos;t deserve by the way. &apos;Hustlers&apos; was terrible. ) and focus on becoming a better singer and dancer. Until then I can&apos;t feel pity for someone who has gotten by on how hot they are.",
