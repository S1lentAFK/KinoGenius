    "reviewBody": "This movie was really amusing to me and, I imagine, people who have a similar background.\n\nI grew up in Suburban Texas, just outside of the major city of Dallas. Most all of our extended family lived another 20 miles out in rural towns. I loved visiting them, learning a different way of life, and the tribal isms that help build stereotypes of Texans and the South in general. Even as an adult, when I return from a trip visiting my extended family, my coworkers say I sound like my Texas accent got a boost.\n\nI love Novak&apos;s take on coming into a culture that&apos;s similar but foreign. The little things that are universal across all Texas, and the things that are unique to small rural towns.\n\nI don&apos;t want to give up anything in the review other than to say give it a chance and if you don&apos;t like it, bless your heart.",
