    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a bit shocked to see a film with some major actors go this under the radar, but here we are. I mostly enjoyed this film. Yes, it rehashes a lot of political thriller tropes, however it updates some for the time. Brian Cox remains an absolute powerhouse of a performer and the film excels when he is on screen. The rest of cast does a fine job and I don&apos;t understand the criticism of Cena. He showed on Peacemaker that he has dramatic chops and I thought he did well for what the role asked of him. The story isn&apos;t too original, but it remains reasonably compelling until the end. For a direct to Peacock film, I was pleasantly surprised.",
