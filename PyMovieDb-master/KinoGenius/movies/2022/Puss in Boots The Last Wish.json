    "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say I expected this from a Puss in Boots sequel 12 years later. The Last Wish is a true standout feature of 2022 and one of the best animated films in some time.\n\nThe new art style, clearly inspired by Spider-Verse, feels right at home in this world. I love how it blended the typical CGI look with the new, more hand-drawn style. That combined with some top notch humor and an incredibly emotional story makes this a terrific watch. The film is very singularly focused on Puss&apos;s arc, leading to some very satisfying story beats. I had a wonderful time watching this movie and I can&apos;t recommend it enough.",
