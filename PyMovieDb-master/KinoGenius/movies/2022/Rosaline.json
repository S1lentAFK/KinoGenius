    "reviewBody": "It was different from that what I&apos;ve seen in the last few months, first I didn&apos;t know what I can expect from a movie like this. With the short playing time of 90 minutes, I didn&apos;t expect that much story and it was the exact amount of story for the time. No useless stretched story and a clear endpoint. Overall was the story something else, it was modern and fresh but the choice of music was a little bit too modern in my opinion. Another point of my criticism is that acting. I love Kaitlyn Dever and enjoyed her performance in Dopesick. In that movie, she wasn&apos;t bad but for me, she felt a little bit misplaced in the role. It didn&apos;t fit that well in my opinion. But overall a solid movie you can watch if you need something refreshing.",
