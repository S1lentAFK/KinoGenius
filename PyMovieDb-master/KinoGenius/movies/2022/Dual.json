    "reviewBody": "I loved this film and it deserves much better ratings.\n\nMy only criticism is that it&apos;s trying too hard to emulate Jorgos Lanthimos&apos;s style, &apos;The Lobster&apos; in particular. Still, since the original Lanthimos has somewhat ditched the avant garde with &apos;The Favourite&apos;, then I can forgive director Riley Stearns for filling the gap.\n\nI get bored easily, but I found this film enjoyable from start to finish, and don&apos;t really understand all the negativity in the reviews. I guess it&apos;s not for everybody, but if you liked &apos;The Lobster&apos; or &apos;Killing Of A Sacred Deer&apos; and are looking for something new along those lines, then I don&apos;t think you&apos;d be disappointed.",
