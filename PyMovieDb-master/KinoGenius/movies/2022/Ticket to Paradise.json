    "reviewBody": "Ticket to Paradise is a completely bog standard romcom. Not a single creative risk was taken in the making of this film. It is all very safe and predictable.\n\nThey cast George Clooney and Julia Roberts and knew that that would be enough to get bums on seats, so they phoned in the rest.\n\nThe comedy is all tried and tested stuff. The plot follows the traditional romcom formula, meaning you won&apos;t find any surprises here.\n\nThis doesn&apos;t make it a bad film, its just got a pretty uninspired feel to it, as if it was made by a marketing team.\n\nThe result is a charming, sweet, but unremarkable film. If you&apos;ve ever seen a romcom then you&apos;ve seen Ticket to Paradise, but it does have its moments.",
