    "reviewBody": "An indie film set in the future from last year. Colin Farrell & Jodie Turner-Smith are raising their daughter w/the help of a robot which they bought refurbished. The parents begin to worry when Yang, Justin H. Min, starts to malfunction & what his potential absence will have on their daughter which prompts Farrell to venture out into the world to find out his background which includes visions of a girl, played by Haley Lu Richardson, who meant enough to him she&apos;s still in his memory banks. Taking a page out of other scifi outliers like Blade Runner, A. I. & even to some extent the Will Smith actioner I, Robot, this film&apos;s message of a robot achieving its own consciousness is lost in its fey, flowery delivery as it feels (which reading the head credits this film was based on a short...probably the best format for this), even at its short running time of 90 or so minutes, bloated by unnecessary visual deviations & flourishes making this at best a beautiful ad for a B & B & at worst a waste of my time. Also starring Sarita Choudhury & Ritchie Coster as robot merchants w/Clifton Collins as Farrell&apos;s neighbor.",
