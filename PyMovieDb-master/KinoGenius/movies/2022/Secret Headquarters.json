    "reviewBody": "There are continuity gaps and characters are flat. It&apos;s CGI heavy. Everything is flashy and shiny and lots of stuff blows up. The jokes are intended for a grade-school audience. Not unexpectedly, the kids are smarter than the adults and end up saving the day.\n\nMake some popcorn and spend an evening with your kids. There are worse things in life.",
