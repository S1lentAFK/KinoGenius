    "reviewBody": "While on wire room duty, a federal agent helps out the target he&apos;s monitoring when they are attacked.\n\nDirector Matt Eskandari offers a bland, flawed fizzled-out film littered with continuity errors and editing issues.\n\nThankfully reliable Kevin Dillon breathes life into Brandon Stiefer screenplay, along with Rhyan D&apos;Errico&apos;s music. Bruce Willis does his hardest to lift the stilted low budget offering above the likes of Anna Nicole Smiths&apos; Die Hard rip off Skyscraper (1996).\n\nWhat could have been in the vein of The Phone Booth, Enemy of the State, Rear Window is so hack-handled and budget tied that it offers nothing of merit aside from CGI blood, smoke and gunshots.\n\nSadly, only worth viewing for Dillion and Willis.",
