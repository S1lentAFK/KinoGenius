    "heading": "Good, wholesome family film",
    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s formulaic and predictable, but this film touches the heart and deals with two moral stories-- that of a dyslexic, hyperactive Trooper who wants to be in the K9 unit... and a shelter dog he&apos;s challenged to work with. If you like this kind of film, you won&apos;t have a dry eye by the end of the movie.\n\nThe acting is good from all parties. Directing is fine, music fits the story, and it&apos;s realistic enough to not suspend belief. There are lots of cliches here... but also some very good lessons to learn, for children and adults alike.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable movie to watch, and good points to be noted, especially in post-viewing discussions with children. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good, basic family-oriented film.",
