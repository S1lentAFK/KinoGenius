    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m rating this a 4 purely because it had some decently creepy stuff. I did not understand what was happening for most of the movie. It felt like someone was bored during the pandemic, gathered a bunch of people (who know maybe very basics in film) and then started filming and created a semi plot after the footage was filmed. Some of it made sense and then anytime I thought I figured it out, I was back to being confused. If it weren&apos;t for the fluff that filled the first half of the movie, it would have had a lot of potential to be a great movie. Just needed some help. It lacked direction and had some major plot holes.",
