    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m sorry for being so judgemental, but these twins were annoying. It is ok to be quiet when necessary, it is even ok not to respond to people you aren&apos;t comfortable with/don&apos;t like/make you upset. BUT...these 2 crossed all boundaries and chose to just not speak to anyone - at all. Going so far as just not only going mute but not moving and having to physically be moved around. That, to me, is ridiculous and manipulative. I don&apos;t doubt these 2 had major mental health issues - but they are no heroes in my book! They acted out in a spoiled manner by literally ignoring everyone in life but each other.",
