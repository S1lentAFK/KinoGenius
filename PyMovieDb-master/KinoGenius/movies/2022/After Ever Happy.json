    "reviewBody": "I have watched the previous movies and I can say that they are just getting bad and bad. Hardin is still a dipsh1t guy who has some serious anger issues but Tessa doesn&apos;t leave him (Because she loves him soooo much duh).. And when she decides to leave him, the guy isn&apos;t leaving her alone (because he doesn&apos;t believe her duhhh).\n\nHardin keeps cribbing and screaming in the first half. Second half gets a little better but it&apos;s still very messily done. Even after four movies, you don&apos;t feel for these guys. They are just some random teenagers who keep crying and fighting and then keep making up.\n\nGirls, this is what toxic guys look like. I hope you learn from the movie, have some self respect in case you find a red-flagged person and leave him for good. It&apos;s NOT your responsibility to fix him.",
