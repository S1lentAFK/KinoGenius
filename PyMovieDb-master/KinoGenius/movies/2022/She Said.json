    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a story of the brave and the courageous, of abuse and injury that&apos;s so outrageous, a vile predator is caged, you&apos;ll feel angered and enraged, as he&apos;s abhorrent, evil, heinous, and quite viscous. Jodi and Meghan lift the lid on these events, revealing a hornets nest of disturbing contents, a factual actual can of worms, makes you agitate and squirm, you&apos;ll be shouting at the screen, as your spleen vents.\n\nA far from uncommon story of abuse when taken individually but, as they&apos;re gradually racked up against one individual the sense of what power and money can achieve, and especially conceal, leaves you questioning what really goes on behind closed doors, and whether those affected will ever come to terms with their past.\n\nGreat performances from Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan who&apos;s tenacity and passion for what they do shines through.",
