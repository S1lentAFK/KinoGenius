    "reviewBody": "Spirited stands out from other adaptations of A Christmas Carol. It puts its own spin on Charles Dickens&apos; classic novella, imagining how things would have continued after that story, as well as how the hauntings were created. However, this movie could have used a visit from the Ghost of Christmas Movie Editing. It&apos;s over two hours long, and it felt like they left every joke and dance number in, when they should have trimmed the fat. Will Ferrell and Ryan Reynolds are a fun pairing, and this musical comedy has its moments, but I doubt it will become a Christmas staple for my family&apos;s holiday season.",
