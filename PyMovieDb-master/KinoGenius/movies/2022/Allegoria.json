    "reviewBody": "Lots of talking about art and philosophy. Each character babbles about something art related and then something spooky happens. That&apos;s it...I think.\n\nSome of the scenes at the beginning reminded me of a David Lynch film, but it never went anywhere and was far less engaging.\n\nFor a 70 minute film I found myself checking the clock often, patiently waiting for a monologues to stop so something strange would happen or a point could be made.",
