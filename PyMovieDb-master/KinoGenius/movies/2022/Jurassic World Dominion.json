    "reviewBody": "Before I went to this film (because my Grandson is nuts about this series of films) I read one newspaper review. It wasn&apos;t glowing, but it was positive. Unfortunately, this is a mess. Others have already talked about the issues I have. Granted, this is an empty headed summer movie, it could still have been done with some serious thought. I was hanging in there throughout with a new dinosaur attack every three minutes, and velociraptors going at fifty miles per hour and not getting tired. Humans being assaulted time after time and yet showing no fatigue. I also didn&apos;t see a scratch on any of them. But the best of all was the promise made to a baby dinosaur and his mother that precluded saving the world from famine. Not to mentioned the coincidences of everyone showing up in just the right places. I still don&apos;t understand how they got into that facility so easily. The return of the original cast was not helpful other than Jeff Goldblum&apos;s sarcasm. Anyway, it&apos;s all been said. This is a poor movie.",
