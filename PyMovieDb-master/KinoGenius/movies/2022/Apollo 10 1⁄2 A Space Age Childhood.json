    "reviewBody": "Not up there the Boyhood, or the Before trilogy, but fun nevertheless.\n\nThe recreation of the 1960s Linklater family tropes is heartfelt and truly etched, and the rotoscope animation is brilliant, but there is a little too much ticking-the-box of 1960s topical events and cultural trends.\n\nThe winsome fantasy of the kid astronaut is meant to be the rocket propellant that binds it and lifts it, but this does not quite come off.",
