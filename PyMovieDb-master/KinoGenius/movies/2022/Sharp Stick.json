I can&apos;t think of a category this doesn&apos;t stink. 2/10 for being in focus with clear audio.\n\nThe non plot meanders aimlessly as we&apos;re slowly and without a hint of subtlety directed to watch the protagonist, because she&apos;s obviously going through some stuff. We&apos;re also given back story using the heaviest tools... come on... show don&apos;t tell!\n\nOveracting from most of the cast can only have come from direction... or maybe the whole cast was high?\n\nI loved Girls, but this isn&apos;t even worth your time to find out. Fly a kite, write an awful review or take up building... but give this a miss. 2/10.",
