    "reviewBody": "You&apos;re with a man who&apos;s very subtly coercive, in a relationship that&apos;s vile and corrosive, playing tricks with how you think, makes you wither, narrow, shrink, this is no way to spend your days, no life to live. Time with friends gives you a chance to float, reflect, of how your mind has crashed and burned, become a wreck, with their help they catch your fall, assist the break with a large maul, evict the poison from your heart, with great effect.\n\nI thought Anna Kendrick was amazing as the mentally anguished and tortured Alice, who&apos;s fairy-tale romance had turned out to be anything but, as she finds out what friendship and love really can be, when those close truly care.",
