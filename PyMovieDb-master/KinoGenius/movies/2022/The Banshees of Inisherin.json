    "reviewBody": "Super locations. Great photography. Masterful Production design. The acting is world class. So why didn&apos;t I enjoy this film? Because it promises to say something and goes nowhere. I&apos;m obviously in the minority here but I wish my expectations hadn&apos;t been raised so high. It&apos;s dark but a slow almost empty darkness. I&apos;ll forget this film very quickly. Which is a good thing for me but doesn&apos;t say much for the quality of the story. It feels like there was much more there somewhere but it didn&apos;t make it out. Perhaps watching it on a rainy Monday evening didn&apos;t help. Also please don&apos;t go thinking this is a comedy or anything at all like &apos;In Bruges&apos;. It&apos;s very far from funny. It&apos;s very far from the quality of that film.",
