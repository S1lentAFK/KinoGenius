I&apos;m just not understanding why any form of racism is ok.\n\nI would have hoped in todays times she would have been better and held herself to a higher standard.\n\nIf I was from Arizona I would definitely be offended, no matter what my color is!! Lol\n\nI&apos;ve been through Arizona many times and have yet to run across the people portrayed. The acting was below par and the story line was way too ridiculous for me.\n\nThe creepy housekeeper watching her go upstairs with the bag..omg! Who wrote that part of the script ðŸ¤” If I was a housekeeper at a hotel I would definitely be offended!! ðŸ˜‚\n\nEveryone can complain about the obvious racism in the movie, but that still doesn&apos;t change that it just was not a good movie. Very disappointing.",
