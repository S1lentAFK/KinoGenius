    "reviewBody": "I&apos;d like to point out that I&apos;m a horror buff, have seen probably around 1000 &apos;scary movies&apos;, and have never come across anything like this. Give me killers/ghosts/clowns/sharks any day.\n\nI will point out, I do have acrophobia to an extent. I&apos;m fine with rides and roller coasters and things like that, but I start to sweat when I&apos;m near a ledge or out in the open at an elevated level, like a rooftop.\n\nI thought I&apos;d give Fall a go, since I&apos;d be comfortable on my couch...but I was very very wrong.\n\nThe imagery in the film is so intense that there were parts where I could only watch 10 to 15 minutes at a time before needing a break because my palms and soles of my feet were incredibly sweaty. It took me forever to actually finish the movie.\n\nThe acting is decent, and the story is pretty basic, but I&apos;ve given the film a rating of 8 because no film has freaked me out as much as Fall did. Not Vertigo, not The Walk, not Skyscraper, not anything.\n\nIf you&apos;re fine with heights, you may find the movie a bit boring I would assume...but if you aren&apos;t fine with them, you&apos;re in for a bumpy ride.",
