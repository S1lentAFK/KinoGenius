    "reviewBody": "I feel like I need a hard shower to get all the sap off after watching this. They used every cliche in the book to pull at the heart strings and create a Norman rockwell-like atmosphere with very fake-looking snow. And it&apos;s pretty much snowing the entire movie.\n\nBut the biggest fault is that the main characters didn&apos;t spend nearly enough time together to fall so deeply in love. I watched this without my wife because I figured she&apos;d find it far too corny, and she would have. The big, emotional speech at the end sounded very familiar, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;ve heard variations in other rom-coms (though I don&apos;t think the com part applies here). Definitely don&apos;t see this becoming a Christmas classic.",
