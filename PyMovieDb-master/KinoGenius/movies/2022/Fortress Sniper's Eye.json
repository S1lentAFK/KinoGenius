    "reviewBody": "Seems Bruce Willis just went on a rampage of crappy films before he retired. Seems like he knew he&apos;d be quitting films so he just made a bunch. 8 in 2021 and 10 films in 2022. That&apos;s got to be some kind of record.\n\nThanks for the other films Bruce, too bad you decided to end your legacy this way.",
