    "reviewBody": "So its a silly story, and when it started I saw it was 2 hours and I thought how can they make this story 2 hours, this will be a drag.... But it wasnt, its actually very good, its very well written and they have very cleverly used the combo of english and spanish to make it funny. The casting is excellent and the ending isnt ruining the movie. For the kind of movie it is, its actually one of the better in recent years.",
