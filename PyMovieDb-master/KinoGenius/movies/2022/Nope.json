    "reviewBody": "1. Commentary on exploitative social media accounts that strive for the most clicks regardless of who they negatively impact.\n\n2. Keke Palmer&apos;s eccentric performance as Emerald. She should be in way more movies.\n\n3. Daniel Kaluuya&apos;s deadpan one liners.\n\n4. Rewatch value, there is build up to each twist and shocking moment. Mysterious and ambiguous scenes become scarier after learning context.\n\n5. Foreshadowing: it is absolutely everywhere. Sometimes done subtly, other times obviously.\n\n6. Subtle details; highly detailed set, script, and outfits, down to the logo on one of the main character&apos;s shirt.\n\n7. Sound effects. It goes beyond typical horror noise cues, using unique sounds to build-up scares. The blood curdling screams loudly echoing as the creature flies by are terrifying.\n\n8. Akira motorcycle shot. Thank you Jordan.",
