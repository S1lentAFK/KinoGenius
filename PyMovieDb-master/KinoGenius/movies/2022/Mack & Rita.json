    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t normally write one star reviews and I&apos;m a huge fan of Diane Keaton, so it hurts me to say this but this movie was a complete disaster! First of all, the story moved so slow that I was practically left with no other choice but to turn it off halfway through the movie. Second, the movie just felt so lost and with no direction. The jokes felt very forced and it didn&apos;t seem as if what was happening was going anywhere. I waited until Diane was on screen, hoping it would help pick up the pace a bit, but even her amazing energy could not save this. It could&apos;ve been so much funnier but instead, every joke just fell flat. In the end, I decided it was not worth any more of my time so I stopped it.",
