    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1955 Chicago. Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler) is a widower trying to protect her son Emmett (Jalyn Hall) from everyday racism. She is concerned as Emmett joins relatives in Mississippi for vacation. Sure enough, his interaction with a white woman leads to his lynching.\n\nI don&apos;t want to be insensitive, but this movie is not really doing anything new. There isn&apos;t much that I didn&apos;t know before. It&apos;s interesting that they show the whistle. Mostly, I am concentrating on the performance of Danielle Deadwyler and her lost of the Oscar nomination. I&apos;ve seen all the nominees at this point. I think I can have her replace Michelle Williams. Deadwyler is mostly doing stoic dignity with a couple of big acting scenes. Williams is doing good work, but she&apos;s not the lead in the movie. Both are great performers. Deadwyler has the bigger role.",
