    "reviewBody": "Had no expectations or knowledge of this film and didn&apos;t know of the novel it is based on. Solely based on the film, it is a decent enough thriller with some thrills but nothing too memorable. A lot of what occurs is vastly predictable including the criminals actions and the entire setup.\n\nIn the end what occurred is what we saw coming. Overall it was solid enough for a one time watch, didn&apos;t drag on too much and had some thrills. The leading actress stands out and her character is given enough depth and backstory giving the audience a reason to care.",
