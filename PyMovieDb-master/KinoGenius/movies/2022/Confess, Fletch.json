    "reviewBody": "I really didn&apos;t think Jon Hamm could pull off the role, but does a more than serviceable job here. He captures the spirit of Fletch, although the story doesn&apos;t seem to rely on the use the various silly disguises, fast talking, and funny aliases that the original used. Nevertheless, there&apos;s enough there to make you believe he&apos;s the same Fletch. I sort of liked the fact that Hamm didn&apos;t try too hard to make the character his own.\n\nThe screenplay could have been a bit more interesting, but still made for a good light-hearted entertainment that&apos;ll put a smile on your face as you watch it. I hope this becomes a modest success at the very least to justify another installment.",
