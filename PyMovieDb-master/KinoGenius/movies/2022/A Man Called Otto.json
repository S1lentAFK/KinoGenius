    "reviewBody": "Wow. I was not prepared for that. I thought I was going to see a comedy film about a grumpy man who gets frustrated with his neighbours. I did not expect to be in tears by the end - and not tears of laughter.\n\nI did not have the experience of the original book or film so I went into this with no particular expectations. It&apos;s been a long time since a movie touched me in this way.\n\nTom Hanks excels as Otto in a character so unlike any other he has played before. His own son played his younger self which added a level of authenticity to the role. The supporting cast brought a mix of humour and pathos resulting in beautiful and moving film that hit all the right notes.\n\nDon&apos;t go and see this without tissues folks!",
