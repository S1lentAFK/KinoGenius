    "reviewBody": "American Julia follows her Romanian husband Francis back to his home country of Romania, she&apos;s quickly aware that a neighbour is watching her, and following her, Francis believes she&apos;s imagining things.\n\nThis is a quality thriller, it has an almost vintage feel about it, it&apos;s a straight up story of a woman being stalked by a sinister being.\n\nIt&apos;s not a complex story, but Julia&apos;s conflict is what&apos;s interesting, is she simply paranoid, is she unfairly maligning the guy living opposite?\n\nI loved the ending, that was such a good, dramatic scene. I know what I&apos;d have said to Francis.\n\nMaika Monroe is excellent as Julia, you truly get the sense of the character&apos;s loneliness and total frustration.\n\nBurn Gorman is very good as The Watcher, he plays these creepy, sinister parts so well.\n\nThis film held my attention from start to finish.\n\n9/10.",
