    "reviewBody": "I think pretty much anything Bruce Willis does at this point is junk.\n\nThe production quality of this movie was so low the opening scene was one of the worst I&apos;ve seen in a movie in years, no substance, no direction, terrible soundtrack, very little atmosphere. And only a dialed in performance by Willis.\n\nLuke Wilson was the only saving grace and even he couldn&apos;t do anything to save this turkey. Save 90 minutes of your life want something good.",
