    "reviewBody": "Amsterdam is a movie that subverts expectations. I went into it not knowing anything about the plot and simply wanting to see the ensemble cast in action. What begins as an eccentric and slightly amusing film becomes quite a serious political drama about America post WW1 and the power of a group of friends holding true to one another.\n\nI certainly can see how the slower pace could put people off, particularly if you have no interest in the conspiracy being unearthed but for me it was an entertaining insight into a part of history I knew nothing about.\n\nThe performances are for the most part great, especially Margot Robbie who is at this stage a bone fide A lister. I would say however that the performance of John David Washington feels a little wooden.\n\nIn an era of short attention spans and superhero films there won&apos;t be nearly enough explosions for some but for those prepared to absorb this work a thought provoking film awaits.",
