    "reviewBody": "B O M B. Wow! It is just hard to comprehend how terrible this movie really is. At the beginning when you see Martin Lawrence brushing his eyebrows with a toothbrush you know it is off to a bad start. To add to that the jokes are just horrendous. I sat stoned face until the end when you see Martin Lawrence&apos;s ugly mug pressed up to the camera. I don&apos;t know if it was the relief that the movie is over or that he is just plain ugly. Or because they were trying to set it up for an even crappier sequel.",
