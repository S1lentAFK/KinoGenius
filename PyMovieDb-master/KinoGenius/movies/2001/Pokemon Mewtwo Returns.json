    "reviewBody": "A new Pokemon movie! Hooray! Now we can find out what's become of Mewtwo & his clones. I loved Mewtwo Strikes Back and this sequel is packed with the same emotion & excitement. We meet a new Team Rocket agent who is just as cool as Jessie & James. I was drawn into the story and was satisfied by the ending. It was good to hear some of the marvellous music from the original too. Keep 'em coming. 10/10",
