    "reviewBody": "While watching this movie, I had absolutely no idea what I would end up rating it. It was not an enjoyable experience. Not until it was over did I realize what a good job John Singleton had actually done. This was not a comedy, nor a romantic story, but a true depiction of SOME (NOT ALL) aspects of Black life. I recognized each and everyone of these characters, for better or worse. They were not exaggerated or sugar-coated, but portrayed in a true light which is often difficult to watch or accept. Which explained my uncomfortableness, I&apos;m sure that was the point and it was well received. 7 out of 10***",
