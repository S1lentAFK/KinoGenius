    "reviewBody": "I don't understand the negative reviews. This is a good movie, well written and pretty original. Great dialogue. The top value of this movie is Julie. Julie and her character are the core of the value of the story and of the serious joy of watching. I won't forget that dance either! (Yes, I am a guy.)",
