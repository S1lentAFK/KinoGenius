    "reviewBody": "Four hot college friends drive off for a night of partying at an abandoned church. Cassie (Melissa Sagemiller) and Sean (Casey Affleck) are getting more serious. They and their friends, Matt (Wes Bentley) and Annabel (Eliza Dushku), leave the party. Another car blocks the road causing a deadly crash. Sean is killed. Cassie is haunted by guilt but darker forces are closing in.\\n\\nThese are hot young people. There is a spooky atmosphere. It&apos;s hinting at something dark. It is set up for a solid if somewhat derivative horror. It&apos;s no sin to be unoriginal. It is however a sin to reveal that the movie&apos;s middle means nothing. In the end, there is no point to half of this movie. It&apos;s a campfire ghost story that pulls its punch at the last minute. It suggests something sinister with the people in the other car but they end with nothingness. It&apos;s disappointing.",
