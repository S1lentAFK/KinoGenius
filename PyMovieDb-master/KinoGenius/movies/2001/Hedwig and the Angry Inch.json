    "reviewBody": "I watched this mainly because Joan Jett rocked with the star of it back in 2001 or so. So, I just expected a rock musical about a drag queen that wanted to make it big, nothing more. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was so much more than that!\n\nFirst off, this film is such a visual piece of art! Secondly, the songs are great! And third- and most important, this film is a beautiful bending of visual and intellectual ideas. It's quite absurdist and crude at times, but mostly, it's philosophical, spiritual and sweet. This is a twin flame movie, for sure! I loved it!",
