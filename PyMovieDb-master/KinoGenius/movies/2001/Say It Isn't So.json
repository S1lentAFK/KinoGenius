    "reviewBody": "In the beginning of the movie, when they develop their relationship, they are unaware of any possibility that they might be brother and sister; therefore it is highly misrepresentative to say this is a movie about incest. This movie definitely shows how people can be closed-minded and cruel. This movie is also another rip-off to the extent that it starts nice and sweet but becomes outrageously extreme. I liked the first part but it was very difficult for me to watch the last of it. The ending I think was nice but I was not paying a lot of attention then.\\n\\nThis movie is definitely an example of something that would be more with less; less outrageous would make it much more enjoyable, especially since Heather Graham is so cute.",
