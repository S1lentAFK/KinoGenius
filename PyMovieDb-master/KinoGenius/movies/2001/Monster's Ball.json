    "reviewBody": "Though Halle Berry was the only performer from this film recognized by the Academy, I do not feel that she was the only actor deserving praise. Sean Combs proved that he belongs in the acting world in just his first on-screen role. His portrayal of Lawrence, a man on Death Row, is understated and powerful. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Sonny is also brilliant. The only fault lies in the writing--neither Lawrence nor Sonny are fully developed. A great ensemble cast makes this film a winner, not Halle Berry alone.",
