    "reviewBody": "You know, it makes me laugh when I read other people&apos;s negative reviews on this movie. Yeah, this movie is riddled with historical inaccuracies and all the outlaws are so darn young and good looking, but hey, that&apos;s not the point. I don&apos;t think this movie was meant to be a serious study about Frank and Jesse James. This movie was made strictly to entertain and to make people laugh.\\n\\nOne already knows from the first five minutes into the movie that this is a comedy/action movie. I enjoyed it for what it was, mindless entertainment! Yeah, Colin Farrell is HOT! As a matter of fact, the rest of the outlaws are all very young and cute. Even if the females audience do not care much for the plot or for the cartoon violence, I&apos;m sure they would get some visceral thrill out of seeing all these good looking young guys together on the screen. The male audience will enjoy the humor and the fight scenes and big explosions and Ali Larter, the pretty blonde actress that plays Zee. Ali Larter reminds me of the models in the old 1970s&apos; shampoo commercials, all shiny blonde hair and big smiles.\\n\\nThis movie was fun to watch from beginning to end. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a fun action comedy.\\n\\nBy the way, now that the DVD is out, I hope everyone catches the deleted scenes from the movie. They are very good. It&apos;s a shame these scenes were not included into the movie, they would&apos;ve showed a little more depth to the characters of Frank and Jesse James.",
