    "reviewBody": "Before the review I want to say, please don&apos;t compare it to G4. This a movie, not a series. I know alot of veterans out there are going to pander this film for the style and characters. I know G4 was amazing, but we gotta move on and try new things.\n\nNow for the review.\n\nTLDR: Its very well made, I give my support for this generation! Of course the story is not the greatest, the songs were alright I was moving to beat in all of them. Characters do there part and together make a great development throughout the film.\n\nStory: It a predictable story and will get you thinking ahead of the film. Its very short on some scenes and will feel very rush. The ending is the shortest of all the scenes. Pacing is really a big issue.\n\nCharacters: When together it really shines and shows the potential! When alone, it all one note. For likeable, the Pegasus is who I found likeable! The others not so much, the sheriff was the bottom of the group.\n\nSound: Well done on audio! The soundtrack was good and the sfx were done right, no question when watching.\n\nOverall: Give a watch! It doesn&apos;t hurt to try, G4 will always be here if you don&apos;t like it! Last thing, please spread love and kindness to people who like this film! Bring friendship not discord!",
