    "reviewBody": "I guarantee its not like the second movie that made you want to gauge your eyes out. This movie did provide a beautiful ending but there was something about it that I felt it was missing. I kinda wished they did a little more with it, it&apos;s almost liked they played it safe this time. Not necessarily a bad thing but there are many ways they could&apos;ve done so much more. I do recommend watching it, it will absolutely exceed your expectations if you were thinking it would be like the second. Give it a go, watch it. It won&apos;t be a waste or your time for sure!",
