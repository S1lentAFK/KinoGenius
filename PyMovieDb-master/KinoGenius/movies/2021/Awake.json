    "reviewBody": "This was a good story and was definitely worth my time. I love apocalyptic, sci-fi stories, so I watched this as soon as it came out. I was on the edge of my seat through most of it. It&apos;s true that there&apos;s a weird religious part in the film, but it was brief and insignificant. Seriously, it&apos;s not worth mentioning. The person who complained about it was probably hoping for another Hollywood flash and bang film. I also enjoyed the film because I&apos;m a mother and could relate to how the main character protected her children.\n\nI was disappointed that the movie was kind of short, and there could have been more character development for some of the actors. The kids in the film were great, and so was the leading lady. If you&apos;re expecting an earth-shaking movie, then this is probably not for you. If you&apos;re hoping to just catch a good movie, then I suggest you give this a try.",
