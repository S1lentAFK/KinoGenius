    "reviewBody": "Flora and Son is yet another feel-good musical comedy drama by John Carney. As a fan of Begin Again, I was excited to watch this new film by the same director. Also, Eve Hewson getting the recognition and breakout she deserves.\n\nEve Hewson finally lands a lead film role which really made me happy and she truly shines as Flora. She is really amazing as a frustrated young mother who sparks interest in music.\n\nThe songs and music were pretty good and it&apos;s a pretty feel-good film. Here, the direction continues to balance out Irish culture, music and a bit of romance. Eve Hewson and Joesph Gordon-Levitt have pretty nice chemistry with good dialogue interaction moments that builds up together.\n\nHowever, the narrative, on the other hand could&apos;ve been more creative or energetic. With some minor flaws, this film still is a nice little film which I enjoyed pretty much.",
