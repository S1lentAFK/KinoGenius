    "reviewBody": "Disappointed. The first 25/30 minutes are good and I thought this would be something cool and a good slasher. Unfortunately, from there it only gets worse.\n\nThe killer reveal was a bit obvious - well, at least I found out very early and I&apos;m not usually the guy who can see plot twists coming - and I can&apos;t even understand the reasons for some victims. It doesn&apos;t make much sense even if it was obvious. The last act seems incredibly rushed with no tension at all and some characters are never developed at all.\n\nGood acting in general, good final girl, cool masks and some interesting deaths save this from being really bad, but it&apos;s not enough to make this a good film.",
