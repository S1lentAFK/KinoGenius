    "reviewBody": "Westerns look like a dying breed. Only every now and then you get another western so it&apos;s waiting for a good one. Old Henry is one of those. Not very fast paced but certainly worth watching. No huge names either, although Tim Blake Nelson was perfect to play his character. The cinematography was good, the acting was more than good, and the story has a little twist that was clever. Definitely worth your time if you like westerns.",
