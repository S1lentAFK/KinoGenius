    "reviewBody": "After finishing watching a movie I always ask myself if I was entertained. In the case of Infinite I would be lying if I said no. It was entertaining, even with some severe plot holes, and scenes that didn&apos;t make much sense. It&apos;s just an interesting concept for a plot, maybe not perfectly executed, but still it was pleasant to watch. The cast was good, no complaining about that, so honestly I don&apos;t get all the extreme negative reviews. What do you expect from a sci-fi movie? It to be realistic? I don&apos;t. I just want to sit down, relax, and enjoy the show. That&apos;s what I did. Is Infinite going to be remembered? Probably not. Do I care? Certainly not.",
