    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s the summer of &apos;61. College student Bob Zellner (Lucas Till) decides to talk to Rosa Parks for a school paper on race relations. It starts him down the road to the civil rights fight and self discovery.\n\nThis movie starts with Bob getting hung from a tree. Next, he jumping to talk to Rosa Parks. Before all that, the movie should introduce the audience to Bob himself. He comes off as unnecessarily clueless. Part of that is Lucas Till and his model good looks. He seems to fit more on a Californian beach. He&apos;s also not showing enough shock. Lucas has a tendency to seem above it all. This is a biopic of a real life person. I have to assume that there is some reality to the performance. The short reel of the real Bob gives off a slightly different vibe except when he&apos;s confronting Doc in that one scene. I do find the portrayal of ingrained racism of that time and place very compelling. I&apos;m fascinated with his relationship to his grandfather. I wish for more of the father son relationship. I absolutely believe that Lucas Till is white. I&apos;m just not sure if he&apos;s Bob.",
