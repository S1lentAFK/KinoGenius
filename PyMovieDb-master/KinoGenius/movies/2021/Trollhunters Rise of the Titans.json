    "reviewBody": "I would rate the film an 8, it tended to repeat itself a lot and sometimes tried to be too self aware, but still had a great story and great action. However they throw all of this away with one of the worst endings in a movie I think I have ever seen, the ending alone was the soul reason I gave this movie a 6.",
