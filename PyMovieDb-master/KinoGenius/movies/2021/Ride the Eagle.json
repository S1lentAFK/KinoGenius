    "reviewBody": "This story sounded cheesy and cliche, but it turned out to be quite a nice story.\n\nThe good: this movie has got a lighthearted, mellow, witty kinda feel to it.\n\nMore good: great actors, BUT they dont really excell at comedy. BUT it&apos;ll do...\n\nThe bad: the jokes are just not up there yet. They just miss the mark a bit. Still reasonably amusing to watch, but with some better direction and timing, it could have been funnier.\n\nNot annoying. Only a bit slow. But the nice kind of slow...\n\n6 and a half star is perfectly capturing the quality of this movie. But I&apos;ll upgrade it to 7 stars, because this movie is so nice and mellow... I liked that...",
