    "reviewBody": "I have read the book around 2009 and when it got man booker it also got a fair amount of criticism for showing India in badlight. Whenever I saw this book in the shelf I was wondering why a movie has not been made which it deserves. Finally it happened in 2021. I felt the white tiger as a movie was some what rushed and all things happened very quickly but thankfully this adaptation doesn&apos;t spoil the books reputation either. A good watch",
