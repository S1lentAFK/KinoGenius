    "reviewBody": "As a gay man I needed to see this for the representation and J. Coolidge. It was kinda what I expected, but I have to be honest... if you switched the gay lead characters with straight lead characters, you&apos;d have any other general Christmas romantic comedy on Hallmark. Maybe slightly above that, but really nothing new here other than the gay main characters.\n\nI did really like most of the characters, but the writing was so generic and beyond cheesy and predictable. It also should have had way more comedy with that great cast.\n\nBUT, a cute Christmas movie nonetheless, by all means. A nice daytime or Sunday night Christmas movie.",
