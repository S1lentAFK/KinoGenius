    "heading": "Quite disappointing",
    "reviewBody": "The thing that surprised me the most about this movie was how boring it is aside from the first and last 20 minutes. The humour has its moments, but the majority doesn&apos;t really work, at least for me. It also lacked action aside from the very end, a lot was off screen or just didn&apos;t exist. Overall was rather disappointed as had been looking forward to it for a while.",
