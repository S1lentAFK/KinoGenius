    "reviewBody": "For all the lonely ones out there searching for a soulmate and lovemate, try this plot of love and you will be matched for sure.\n\nA decent christmas romantic comedy with loads of lights and props that gives a rush of x-mas, a story that you will hang on to due to its abnormalities, and last but not least the great and funny acting by the two mains, but also the rest of the cast. Its the chinese kidnapped victim from &apos;&apos;patriots day&apos;&apos; and the little sister of the balded boss of &apos;&apos;need for speed 1&apos;&apos; that recieves the price from the grumpy old man as some of the sweetest youve seen for years.\n\nYes its sweet, and a little sad too, it has a good screenplay, and the editing gives you quite a few surprises that is so hilarious that i lolled my way through this all on my own.\n\nAnd that is not an award that i give away so easily, so try it if youre curious, you wont be dissapointed, here theyve hit the target very well.",
