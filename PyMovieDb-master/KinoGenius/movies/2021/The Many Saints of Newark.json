    "reviewBody": "If the Sopranos had relied on this film to launch the tv series, the show would never had been released.\n\nIts an average film, neither offensive to the brain nor exhilarating, but it fails miserably to develop any excitement to the &apos;coming&apos; of Tony.\n\nIf you want to watch a movie about growing up to become a gangster...watch Goodfellas :)",
