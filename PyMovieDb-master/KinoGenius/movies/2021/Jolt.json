    "reviewBody": "Jolt tries pretty hard to be Crank, Atomic Blonde, and John Wick, but it ends up falling short in most key areas such as poor directing and writing, a plot that could&apos;ve been quite interesting but ended up being a overcomplicated mess, action scenes ruined by weak choreography and too much quick-edits, and mediocre performances.\n\nThere are a few redeeming qualities though such as decent cinematography, some cool music, fast pacing, and a pretty good cast lineup.\n\nOverall, this was just another bland, generic, and overall forgettable action flick, and I wouldn&apos;t really recommend it unless you just wanna burn off 91 minutes of your time & got nothing better to do.",
