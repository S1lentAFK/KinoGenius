    "reviewBody": "An odd proportion of super negative reviews on here, it makes me think they are written by an alternative production crews. Really not a bad action flick, decent pace, some interesting developments. Sure the script and production could have been a bit better, but for a Netflix home brew, not bad at all. Anybody giving this a 1 or 2 is being ridiculous.",
