    "reviewBody": "The reasonings and arguments presented in this film are brilliant and anyone who can&apos;t see that just doesn&apos;t have the ears to hear. The writing is extraordinary and the pain is real. I watched with my teenaged sons and American Skin stayed with us for a long time as we discussed, dissected and reveled in its themes. It will probably stay with us forever. Any critic who gives this film a poor review should never be allowed to review Black film again. All their biases are out for us all to see. Mr Parker pulled this film off with a tiny budget and look what he did!! So good. ALL police departments must change their training to include deescalation protocols. Let&apos;s hope this film opens the ears, eyes and hearts of the decision makers of the training programs.",
