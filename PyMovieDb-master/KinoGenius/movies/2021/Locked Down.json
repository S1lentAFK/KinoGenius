    "reviewBody": "A very pleasant movie for a rainy day. Kudos to the writer who wrote the interesting dialog that was delivered by the two main actors. I especially liked Anne Hathaway and her many monologues. The scenery in London was nice and the story kept my interest. A bit on the intellectual side, but that is what made it good for me.",
