    "reviewBody": "The movie had so much potential, the handling of the situation failed miserably. The whole scientific approach was laughable really, the alleged scientist spent the entire film feeling sorry for herself why they gave us no clue to that. The concept of the film could have been really great but it lacked passion, emotion and feelings at all.",
