    "reviewBody": "Went on a whim to see this movie expecting to learn a little about val kilmer... Was not expecting to feel so moved, heartbroken, inspired, & really just feel as emotional as i felt leaving the theater. A movie about acting , the creative process , overcoming the obstacles in front of us & continually moving forward despite of them. This movie really spoke to me ! Also loved that it was narrated by his son.",
