    "reviewBody": "Usually, movies get a very high rating from the first hundreds, because a lot of people involved want to support it in an unfair exaggerated way.\n\nHow many times I&apos;ve been fooled...\n\nNow why would people want to sink a movie in an exaggerated way?\n\n3 Stars average, you must be kidding.\n\nThis is not a kind of Zombie Strip film...\n\nI didn&apos;t expect much and I was entertained by almost every scene.\n\nNo scene is boring, they all have that little spice.\n\nThe dialogues are well developed and aimed to a purpose, not that fast cool urban slang talking that make no sense, used so often lately to hide the lack of reasoning of the writers.\n\nThe characters are well drawn, all of them, even the 2nd and 3rd roles.\n\nActing is top, from everybody, and Olivia Cooke is handsome and sexy like never before. She&apos;s one of my favourite actresses, now, because by this movie, I finally will remember her name, now.\n\nAbout the story, its not what I really like to watch, drugs and money, and I found myself taken along by an extremely well-paced movie, where I did never check my watch.\n\nThat is pretty rare in these days of mindless Netflix monopoly.\n\nThank you for that.\n\nLast but not least : the movie made me buy the book.\n\nYes, it&apos;s all true, about the machine ...",
