    "reviewBody": "This movie is just for fun. Do not take seriously and enjoy the ride. Pure action, good acting and acceptable (not great) FX&apos;S. Frank Grillo is still believable as an action movie star and Mel Gibson is great as a villain too. So, forget twists and great scripts and enjoy the ride, just for fun.",
