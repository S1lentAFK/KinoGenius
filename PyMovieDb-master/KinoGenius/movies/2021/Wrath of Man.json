    "reviewBody": "Guy Ritchie is after Quentin Tarantino and The Coen Brothers one of my favorite directors. With sublime movies like Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and The Gentlemen, he&apos;s one of those directors you follow and are curious and excited about when a new movie comes out. But not all his movies are of the same quality. Like Sherlock Holmes for example (which I found mediocre) Wrath of Man is just passable. It&apos;s all well directed but the quality is just not there. And it&apos;s a movie with Jason Statham, so it speaks for itself what you will get. Statham never laughs, Statham can&apos;t be beaten, Statham wants revenge, in short Statham plays the same character every time. A bit like Liam Neeson. I don&apos;t say those are bad actors, certainly not, but it&apos;s just always the same. Wrath of Man is full of mindless action, a lot of dead people, a lot of questionable scenes (like the heist for example that looked like doomed to fail). I watched the movie trying not to yawn, I was hoping to get those great dialogues Guy Ritchie is known for, but that just never happened. Wrath of Man is just okay to watch once, but that&apos;s it, certainly not at the same level as the other movies from Guy Ritchie.",
