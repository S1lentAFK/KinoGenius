    "reviewBody": "A group of vigilante criminals call themselves the Misfits. Ringo (Nick Cannon) steals from bank safe deposit boxes and gives to the poor. Violet (Jamie Chung) rescues human trafficking victims. Explosive expert Wick (Mike Angelo) blows up evil. The Prince (Rami Jaber) is a con artist. The group recruits escape expert Richard Pace (Pierce Brosnan) with his daughter Hope (Hermione Corfield). They have to rob private prison owner Schultz (Tim Roth) who is holding a large gold deposit in a middle east prison for a terrorist group.\n\nThis is bad but I&apos;m also a sucker for heist movies. It&apos;s trying to be cool by infusing itself with oil-moneyed Abu Dhabi and faux flashy directing. The net effect is a clueless fakeness to everything. It&apos;s like taking a dump in a gold plated bathroom. Sure, it may be fun to do it once but if it&apos;s actually your bathroom, it says something else about you. The only good news is the suaveness of Pierce Brosnan who almost pulls off the whole affair. On the other hand, there is no way to overcome how tired I&apos;ve become with Nick Cannon. The caper is rather silly but it uses a real world group as terrorists. It&apos;s caught between silly and awkwardly real. It&apos;s bad but I&apos;m a sucker. What can I say.",
