    "reviewBody": "Just saw the movie in avant-premiere here in Belgium. Had a blast, and my daughters (11 and 17) really loved it. Sure, there&apos;s quite a bit of fan-service but I was very happy to see they kept the style of the previous movies, it has a dash of The Goonies combined with the charm of the 80&apos;s movies and the ending is just great. Really did not expect it to be this good, but man am I happy they did what they did. Great movie, just plain good fun like in the good old days. Go see it!",
