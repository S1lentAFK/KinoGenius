    "reviewBody": "Not as raunchy as Superbad, witty as Booksmart or silly as Harold and Kumar, but Plan B is a more understated more sweet than bitter movie about 2 high school friends, Sunny and Lupe, who go on an overnight road trip to find the Plan B pill in a neighboring town. The humor is drawn from the women trying to navigate through, the silliness of high school life, the everyday of South Dakota and being women of color - the movie isn&apos;t about race at all but it is an important fabric of their background and journey. Enjoy the movie like a walk to get some ice creme with your best friend. You probably won&apos;t post about it on social media but still a pleasant way to spend the afternoon.",
