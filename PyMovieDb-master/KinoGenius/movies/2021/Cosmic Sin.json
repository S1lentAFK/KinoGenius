    "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a scifi fan like me you probably read the premise and be quite interested. Bruce Willis wasn&apos;t anything positive or negative for me but I thought it would be a sign of a high quality movie. Well... I watched the first 30 Minutes of this and... it&apos;s bad. Like really bad. It&apos;s not like this one thing in it is bad like for example the plot is a bit weak. But when you&apos;re at the point where even I critique the cinematography and color grading you have to be at a very low point to the degree of college-first-indie-movie-attempts-bad. This is usually stuff I can overlook quite easily because I don&apos;t notice.\n\nThis film basically has everything bad a film can have. From every category. Take your pick what you think is the worst.",
