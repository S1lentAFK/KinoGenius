    "reviewBody": "4 out of 5 stars.\n\nIt is a strong emotional journey about a coming of age story when a young teen has a seizure. To only find out he has a tumor. It can be removed in his brain but it will have complications that will take away his hearing. He decides to plan a road trip and make a playlist of sounds along the way. Which he runs into Wendy (Madeline Brewer) which she is also on the run to new york. They both go together. Making memories and recording sounds.\n\nThe plot is good. Cute and emotional. Keean Johnson and Madeline Brewer did a fantastic job with there characters. The idea of losing hearing is tough. The noises of music. Nature. Voices and so much more taken away can be scary. The movie does not into that teen romance cliche. Which is a good thing. But the chemistry of the two characters is sweet and perfecr when they are on screen.\n\nGreat cast. Fun direction and music score. The plot is good with an emotional characterization. It is definitely worth checking out.",
