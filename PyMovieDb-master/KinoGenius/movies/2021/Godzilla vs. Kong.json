    "reviewBody": "I love Godzilla, I love Kong. Face to face they fight like there is no tomorrow for one of them. The battle is very entertaining and breathtaking. Visual are the best of all other monster verse by WB.\n\nThe weakness is in the plot and story telling. They should paid a bit more attention on the story and human characters to make them at least interesting.\n\nBattle is 10/10 Story and plot 4/10.",
