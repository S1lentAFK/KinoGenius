    "reviewBody": "This is very low budget and the writing and story have some craft issues. That said, if you can get to the core of the fight scenes and story you&apos;ll find some unique moments. The main actor is the best he&apos;s ever been and really showed the beauty of jiu jitsu. This is as much a rocky comeback story as it is an homage to the power of jiu jitsu. Now, imagine getting this main actor a top notch script, budget and director? I would pay to see that.",
