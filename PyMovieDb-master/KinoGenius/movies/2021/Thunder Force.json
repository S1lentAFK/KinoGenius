This movie has been made about 30 times but hey.. there&apos;s a few chuckles and it kills some time.\n\nIf you go into this thinking your gonna be surprised or impressed. You&apos;re gonna hate it. I say, lighten up and have some fun. Because that&apos;s all this silly film is. Fun and empty calories.",
