    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve seen both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson act their behinds off and it was great. I&apos;ve seen humor and dark humor work wonders for DC. I&apos;ve seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.\n\nInstead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn&apos;t, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!\n\nBut the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.\n\nEven the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.\n\nThe more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.",
