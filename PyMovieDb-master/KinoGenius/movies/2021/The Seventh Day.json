    "reviewBody": "The Seventh Day is an exorcist film that makes me wish somebody would steal my soul so that I don&apos;t have to witness films like this one. The film tries extremely hard to be scary and unique yet it simply is not either of these things. I struggled so hard to sit through this film as it is chalk full of clich√©s and tries to hard to be like other exorcism films that are simply, well... better. Now, with all of that being said I am a positive person and do like to see the good in everything. There are some decent moments within this film (though I could count them on one hand) and the acting isn&apos;t terrible. Other than those two things I wouldn&apos;t recommend that anyone watch this film, definitely not worth it.",
