    "reviewBody": "The Electrical Life of Louis Wain is an incredible drama that&apos;s funny, extremely emotional and eccentric almost to a fault. A film that&apos;s closer to a true heartbreaking tragedy, despite all it&apos;s stylish quirks.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch adds another terrific lead performance to his already impressive career with a tragic yet loveable character. He also has superb chemistry with Claire Foy, who is great and essential to the emotional core of the film.\n\nWill Sharpe&apos;s direction is fantastic, consistently beautiful in its imagery and effortlessly stylish. The music by Arthur Sharpe is amazing, matching the films tone perfectly by being both painful and inspirational.",
