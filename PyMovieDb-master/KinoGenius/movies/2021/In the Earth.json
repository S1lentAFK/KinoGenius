    "reviewBody": "In the Earth can feel dull at times and it&apos;s lack of answers is extremely unsatisfying but it has enough individual parts that work to make it a good and unique horror movie. Joel Fry, Reece Shearsmith and Ellora Torchia all give great performances. There are some extremely disturbing moments and oddly funny parts. Ben Wheatley&apos;s direction is really good even if some of his stylistic choices really don&apos;t work. The music by Clint Mansell is amazing.",
