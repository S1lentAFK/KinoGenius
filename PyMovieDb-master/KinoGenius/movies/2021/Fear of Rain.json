    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s not a bad film, it&apos;s just not a nine like others have said and it&apos;s not an accurate depiction of schizophrenia. It&apos;s more of a less sophisticated take on A Beautiful Mind with the story line of Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window. I feel like the writer watched both of these films on a Friday night, then wrote this the next day. It&apos;s a little slow and would have benefited from being trimmed by twenty minutes or so. The dialogue feels forced and lacks flow. If you&apos;re bored, give it a go.",
