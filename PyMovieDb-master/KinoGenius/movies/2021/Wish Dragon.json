    "reviewBody": "The comparisons to Aladdin are apt. A funny genie, a lower-class guy and upper-class girl connecting on similar emotional state, inability to wish for love, wishes to be a prince(ling), the villain has been looking for genie for a long time, themes of trust and lies. It gets away with it, though, by recognizing the connection and finding ways to subvert it. Long the Dragon&apos;s arc is strong, there are several very funny moments (traffic scene is excellent), and the animation is beautiful.",
