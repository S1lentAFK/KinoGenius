    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a nicely animated musical to a degree. I feel it&apos;s easier to enjoy if you just treat it like a musical rather than a movie as the characters sing every few scenes. What I find compelling was the characters themselves being honest, a little standard but interesting in their own rights. If they spent some time to develop individual characters it would have shown alot better. It&apos;s a nice watch and one of the better Netflix originals.",
