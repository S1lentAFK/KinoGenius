    "reviewBody": "Its not what people expected and thats why everyone is hating on it. Its a mental health movie - and something we dont get a lot of. Riz is an amazing actor, and the kids were fantastic too. Well worth your time - but dont go into it expecting an all out action film. Its a family drama through and through.",
