    "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t say I was bored whilst watching Warning but it could have been so much better. The ideas were there, in fact you could make several different sci-fi movies with all the ideas from Warning. The problem is that now it all felt like an incoherent mess, it looked like short movies glued together in a movie without a clear comprehensive story. The acting wasn&apos;t bad, the futuristic views were there, but the execution could and should have been much better and that&apos;s a pity.",
