    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s 1971 France. Delphine Benchiessa (Izïa Higelin) works at her family&apos;s rural farm. Her father berates her for being too slow to find a man. Unbeknownst to him, she&apos;s a lesbian. Her girlfriend surprises her by marrying a local boy. In Paris, she gets caught up with a group of militant feminists. She falls for their leader Carole (Cécile de France). After her father suffers a stroke, Delphine is forced to go home and take care of the farm.\n\nIt&apos;s another version of the tragic lesbian love story. I do wonder if 1971 France is a little too late to have this story. Usually, it&apos;s Victorian ladies on a gravel beach trying to discover lesbianism. In reality, rural conservatism and family dynamics do account for it. These ladies are not ignorant of the world. The 70&apos;s is not all disco and gay. It&apos;s still a fight for rights and acceptance. The danger isn&apos;t as high, and the story becomes smaller. Delphine could always run off and abandon the farm. It&apos;s not like society prevents her from getting a job in Paris. The issue becomes more internal and personal. It&apos;s a relationship movie.",
