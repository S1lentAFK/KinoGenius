    "reviewBody": "An alien race has invaded the Earth starting in Europe. After 5 years of relentless defeats where the Mimics seem to anticipate every move, the United Defense Force finally has a victory with the invention of a new jacket technology. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) is hailed as an example of the new success. William Cage (Tom Cruise) is a military media officer. General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) is sending him on the first wave to cover the expected victory. He is arrested and forced to fight under Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). He manages to kill a large Mimic. He is sprayed with its blood and dies. He wakes up the previous morning as a prisoner about to go into battle.\\n\\nThe action is fantastic. The idea is terrific. Tom Cruise starts as his arrogant stock character and transition into his superhero stock character. Emily Blunt continues to excel in a character reminiscent of her character in Looper. Everything comes together. This is funny and exciting. Doug Liman puts it all together into a great thrilling ride.",
