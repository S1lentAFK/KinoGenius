    "reviewBody": "Jees, what a let-down. After 'Breaking Bad' no one could deny that Bryan Cranston is a formidable actor, capable of amazing drama. And he signed on for this. Don't get me wrong - it's not bad-bad. It's just nowhere near what he should be starring in. He plays a half-blind Russian thief (with a slightly dodgy accent sometimes) who takes a single mother hostage in order to help him retrieve his loot.\n\nThat's about it. Alice Eve plays his hostage and she does it as well as the story will allow. The simple thing about this film is that it's just so run-of-the-mill it's barely worth talking about.\n\nYou won't hate it, but you won't remember it in a week's time either.\n\nBryan (and Alice), you're both capable of bigger and better things.\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",
