    "reviewBody": "it was extremely &apos;even&apos;. nothing seemed overplayed. well balanced storytelling. as someone else wrote, best war movie i&apos;ve seen in years...and while we&apos;re at it, best clint movie in a few outings, as well... i agree that the ending is a bit sudden. but there was no reason to drag it out, either... i don&apos;t feel it lingered on any one dynamic of what would be expected from a film like this...not TOO much violence or proselytizing/flag waving or lingering on casualty horrors... it doesn&apos;t, on the other hand, turn away from any of the ugliness, either... i thought bradley cooper did a great job in the role. the changes he gradually instilled into the character were subtle but present. it&apos;s as well done a war movie as i&apos;ll ever need.",
