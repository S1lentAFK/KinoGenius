Why rate it so low (3,8 at the moment I'm writing)?\n\nWell I think that this movie is OK, the girls are sexy (some of them to be precise), males are nice (most of them), kids are small, smart, endearing kids and the overall result is a well written, heartwarming comedy.\n\nDon't be fooled by the low rating which I think it's going to get higher. I'd give it a 6,5 but since this is impossible, I'll give it a solid 7, just to start.",
