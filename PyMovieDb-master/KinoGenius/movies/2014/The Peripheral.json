His solution seems more didactic, ignoring, maybe, the virtues of ambiguity and suggestion.\n\nBut, sure, well acted, wel crafted scene by scene, offering fair dialogue and tension, it is one of rare films proposing the old fashion atmosphere of classic horrors.\n\nAnd this is more than a simple virtue.",
