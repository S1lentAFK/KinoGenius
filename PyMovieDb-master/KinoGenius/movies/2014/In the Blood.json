    "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed the story, the set-up, with the family dynamic between grooms father and his son. Interesting twists and turns, great action and realism. The club scene was terrific and the fight sequences well done. The mountain scenery was stunning and the zip line scenes, freaked me out. Gina's acting continues to improve with every project. The slow build of frustration and emotional hopelessness was wonderfully portrayed.\\n\\nI would have liked to see a bit more character development and dialog. Derek's father and sister needed more lines to show the turmoil of doubt that Derek's father had towards Ava.\\n\\nWatched it on Direct TV and started the movie very late. I could have paused the movie and come the next day to finish viewing it but I couldn't - I was hooked.\\n\\nLoved it - heart pounding suspense.",
