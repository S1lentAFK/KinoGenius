    "reviewBody": "When a newly wed young couple accept an invitation to a club from a very suspicious looking taxi driver whilst on their honeymoon they fall prey to some unclear Satanic cult & she then becomes pregnant with the Devil's child. There's a lesson to be learned! This is basically a Rosemary's Baby clone but for the modern age. Filmed in the found footage style, a sub genre that has been frankly done to death, and although I felt that it wasn't entirely necessary for this movie they did at least do a reasonable job. Acting is good & there are a few decent special effects thrown in but on the downside it is fairly slow for most part, the shaky camera work does become annoying at times & plot wise it doesn't offer much.",
