    "reviewBody": "The Son of God is a powerful true story about Jesus Christ's story from his birth to his resurrection. It has been called a TV movie that got a theatrical release. That is true to a point. The effects and acting could have been better, but if you are going to see effects or acting then I suggest Gravity or American Hustle. The reason you watch a movie like this is to get a vague idea of what it was like to be Jesus or a disciple. The story was a bit jumpy, but it had about 30 years to cover in 2 hours. The center of the movie is about Jesus' last trip, to Jerusalem. The story itself is very moving and touching. It is a must see or Christians or anyone of faith. Diogo Morgado, Jesus, was phenomenal and a gem in this movie. All in all, it is gripping, heart-breaking, and captivating that will be sure to have you in tears.",
