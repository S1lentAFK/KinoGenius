    "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this film, maybe its my style of film, strong psychological film. Sure some things didn't make sense but overall it was great, i don't get the low ratings for real. It deserves to be watched and i am sure it will make you feel uncomfortable in some way. I give it a solid 6.5 and for me its better than evil dead rise but as i told before maybe its my kind style of movie that made me enjoy it so much. It was dark and felt like i should watch my door the entire time i watched this., made me feel unsafe and at some point i was at the edge of my sit. Maybe people didn't like this cause its a remake of an old movie but give it a chance, i am sure you will enjoy it.",
