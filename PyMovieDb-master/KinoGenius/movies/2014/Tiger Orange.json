    "reviewBody": "Here we see an interesting concept....a gay themed movie about two gay brothers, one a bad boy, who&apos;s lived in the LA gay scene, and the other, a discreet, conservative shop owner in a rural area. The bad boy actor did an amazing job. He was a bit over the top, but was convincing. When bad boy faces homelessness in LA, he goes back home to his brother. This is when we get to see some underlying resentments resolved and perhaps some anti-social behavior modification? Ending left me a little confused....but overall a good production with a good pace and script.",
