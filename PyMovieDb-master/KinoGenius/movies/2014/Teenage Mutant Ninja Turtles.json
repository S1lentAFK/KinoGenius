    "reviewBody": "This is one of those animations that pleases everyone, from a 5-year-old to a 15-year-old teenager, a 35-year-old adult and a 75-year-old.\n\nThe story can be minimally complex for the little ones, but in itself, it is extremely fun and brings some interesting reflections throughout its plot. Both in the original language and in the dubbing (Brazilian Portuguese), the voices and their slang are perfectly matched to the characters, what a perfect cast! Only the jokes with references to PT-BR, made me laugh more than I should.\n\nMr. Spilnter is a little left out, but nothing that bothers him. What bothers you is that some drama cliches are present in your character. However, only in him... (which I find strange, as the story of the film is not predictable).\n\nI thought changing April's ethnicity was just another way to cash in on diversity, but it doesn't seem like that, and yes, I like this version of the character.\n\nThe movie is amazing for those idiots whose middle school jokes still occupy their mind! Did I describe you?\n\nWatch it in the cinema right away!",
