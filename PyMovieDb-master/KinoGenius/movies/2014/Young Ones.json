    "reviewBody": "The movie doesn't add much to the sci-fi genre.But, the story can be interesting if you pay a lot of attention. That's one of the major problems with this movie: The story starts in a boring way making it a challenge to keep up watching but it changes it's paste when getting near to the end.At least, the actors did their best to show emotions(which are basically anger & revenge). What i liked a lot was that the movie shows many young actors with potential to make more interesting movies IF they still follow these same styles of films. I somehow feel that this movie could have been much more if the story was developed in a other way. In conclusion, i think this movie was not that bad but neither would i watch it again.",
