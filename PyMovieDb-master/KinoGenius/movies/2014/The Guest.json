    "reviewBody": "Creepy stranger premise has been used in horror or mystery to varied effect, the latest Jennifer Lopez&apos;s flick is an example of how not to welcome this premise. Luckily, The Guest has the luxury of having suave lead actor and good atmosphere for a thriller. Some of the kinks are predictable, but the dark humor as well as bizarre revelations offer much needed novelty to the movie.\\n\\nDavid (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son. He&apos;s well-mannered and seems trustworthy, thus the family welcomes him openly. Upon his stay, strange accidents begin to happen, and suspicion arises with the casualties. The most important hook is Dan Stevens&apos; portrayal of David. He looks like a rugged debonair, this is not average smooth, this is Ryan Gosling&apos;s level of smoothness.\\n\\nStevens delivers a wide variety of emotions, he can be either friendly or deadly. Backed by good cast, such as Maika Monroe as the Anna Peterson and Lance Reddick as Mayor Carver, the movie has a solid degree on acting performance. The exchange of banter is enjoyable, often resulting in manipulation or downright violence for David&apos;s benefit. It elevates the human drama between him, the Peterson family and whoever unlucky enough to be in their immediately vicinity.\\n\\nMystery of David&apos;s real identity is crafted slowly and it&apos;s compelling enough to pique interest without revealing too much. The film also has a touch of humor, albeit slightly crude. Strangely, in the third act it changes tone drastically for the climax. This shift is a bit odd considering it plays the thriller aspect with steady pace for the majority of early parts, although this explosive tone does have the merit of being entertaining.\\n\\nThere are short bursts of Hollywood style carnage, but they are modest, not all out gunblazing from the start like Bourne or the recent John Wick. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact.. Good practical effect for the blood and explosion as well as its highly unorthodox soundtracks make the faster pace scenes more satisfying.\\n\\nHaving good mesh of action, mystery and comedy, The Guest is enigmatically fascinating.",
