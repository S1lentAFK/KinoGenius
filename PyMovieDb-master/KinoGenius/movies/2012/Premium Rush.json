    "reviewBody": "I used to own a bike..then I bought a car..anyway. Basically guy on bike versus bad guy in car. With the whole love story slash you could a been somebody thrown in. I really enjoyed this movie. It&apos;s definitely leaving the brain at the door, but in a nice way. There are no major action scenes. Acting, storyline, action, ending..I literally can&apos;t fault any of this. The director kept it very realistic; with a hint of... dare I say eighties ..we can do it nostalgia.\\n\\nFor the movie buffs I&apos;d say, Gleaming the cube mixed with Taxi (original french version..we all known US version was rubbish). Adrenalin sports guy takes on the system. Watch it.",
