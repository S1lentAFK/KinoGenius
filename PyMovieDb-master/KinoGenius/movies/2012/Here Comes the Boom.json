    "reviewBody": "Here Comes the Boom is Kevin James latest film which sees him tackling the world of MMA. James a lifelong fan of MMA trained in mix martial arts for this role and it is evident in his performance as a teacher turned UFC fighter.(This being the first film with official UFC licensing.\\n\\nThis film is aimed at the same demographic as those who enjoyed Chuck and Larry or King of Queens, its an interesting watch with enough depth to keep you watching. Though this film has a few good laughs and a steady if a somewhat predictable story line its main flaw is attention to detail with the minor characters that make the story.\\n\\nOverall it is worth a watch but don&apos;t expect to see it on any all time great lists. The best is yet to come from Kevin James and I am sure we will see it from him in the future.",
