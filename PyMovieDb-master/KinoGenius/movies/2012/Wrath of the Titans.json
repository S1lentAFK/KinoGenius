    "reviewBody": "Although Clash of the Titans was universally dismissed as an overwhelming disappointment \\u2013 and featured the worst post-converted 3D ever \\u2013 it raked in the big bucks and a sequel was naturally green-lit by Warner Bros. With a new director (Battle LA&apos;s Jonathan Liebesman replacing Louis Leterrier) and an extra $25m to toy with, Wrath was given the opportunity to learn from its predecessor&apos;s mistakes. Alas, this loud and sporadically entertaining mess largely fails to deliver; Sam Worthington&apos;s acting again doesn&apos;t cut the mustard, the action is well-choreographed but repetitive, and the CGI remains below par considering the dosh thrown at it. However, it&apos;s the lack of imagination and unpredictability in the plot department that truly stifles the proceedings. If you get to the end of the first act and don&apos;t already know how the rest of the movie is going to play out, you&apos;re probably sleeping. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes spice things up as Zeus and Hades respectively, and Toby Kebbell&apos;s comic sidekick is a successful ploy to inject the humour sorely missing from Clash, but it&apos;s not enough to make this misfire recommendable.",
