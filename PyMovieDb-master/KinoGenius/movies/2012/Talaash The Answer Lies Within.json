    "reviewBody": "The movie is weaved out of two fabrics, one of a crime-noir with many interesting and mysterious characters thrown in and the other of a drama about a couple dealing with the death of their only child.\\n\\nThe film introduces you to a promising plot dealing with the mysterious death of a movie star, and as the first half progresses the plot gets laden with many characters. As revelations continue to pop in the &apos;search&apos; gets intense and just before the intermission the plot gets seated at a juncture beyond which the &apos;search&apos; only looks more promising. But then comes the second half and the plots veers off in a different direction altogether, the intense buildup gets diluted, the story becomes sluggish as the psychological tribulations of a couple suffering from a tremendous loss take center-stage.\\n\\nFor those who were expecting a taut thriller the first thirty minutes or so of the second half transform the movie into a momentarily vapid experience. The complete shift of focus makes you ponder over the possible entwinement of these two fabrics but because these two fabrics were not rolled out simultaneously but in steps your interest in the mysterious story which was supposed to be the backbone of the plot begins to fade. After a while that story is picked again and as the plot borders its climax the intensity gets built up again. The climax is one which you could have expected around ten minutes before it actually happened and though it fits in the scheme of happening in the plot somewhere you feel that you have been left unsatisfied.\\n\\nThe problem is not with the plot or its climax, but with the weaving of the two stories in the plot, the transition from thriller to drama did not seem to be too smooth to me. Although the glimpses of the psychological quagmire in which the parents are stuck are shown in the first half but the way in which the story of the distressed husband and his closeness to a prostitute takes the centre-stage in the second half makes you doubt if the story of the dead movie star is actually that important.\\n\\nAamir as the policeman and the troubled householder, Rani as the grieving wife and Kareena as the mysterious prostitute were good in their respective roles, but the best performance of the movie, in my opinion, was by Nawazuddin Siddiqui who portrayed the character of a cripple named Tehmur. Siddiqui really blossomed in the character, he was really into it.\\n\\nOverall it is a fine movie and worth at least one watch. The climax, I must say, though not entirely satisfying is at least unique. Nothing like anything you have seen recently in mainstream Bollywood.",
