    "reviewBody": "This is a fast paced comedy/slasher type film. It uses references from different genre&apos;s and different movies. For me, this is part of the attraction as it jumps from one genre reference to another all while paying homage to some classic horror films. The story, although for some seeming to be all over the place, all makes more sense towards the end of the movie. I can&apos;t go in to the how or why because I will be giving away the plot, but it comes together and travels along quite quickly. It&apos;s no &apos;Shaun Of The Dead&apos; (that will hard to beat), but it is different and also takes the p!ss out of the teens of our generation, and who doesn&apos;t like that? So I give this film a 7 out of 10.",
