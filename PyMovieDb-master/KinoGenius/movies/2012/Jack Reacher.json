    "reviewBody": "Flanked by plush production values and an interesting supporting cast (including Werner Herzog as a baddie), Tom Cruise investigates at his leisure an apparent spree killing treading the mean streets as a laconic investigator after whom the film is named like Steve McQueen in 'Bullitt' (which also had Robert Duvall in it); and both prove hot stuff behind the wheel of a car.\n\nCruise has been shot throughout so he looks as tall as or taller than most of the other men in the film; so one admires him for agreeing to willowy Rosamund Pike as his leading lady.",
