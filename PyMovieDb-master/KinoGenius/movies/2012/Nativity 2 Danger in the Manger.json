David Tennant is an upgrade on Martin Freeman, as is Joanna Page on Ashley Jensen. Marc Wootton is basically the same, as are Jason Watkins and Pam Ferris.\\n\\nThis one doesn't have as much charm as the original, not helped by the majority of it feeling like a copy. Sure, some things are changed but it's practically the same story - except for that fact that there is no actual Nativity play involved, so there's that. I still didn't dislike it though, it serves its purpose I guess.",
