    "reviewBody": "Such a disgusting movie ever. I am from Turkey but I have never seen those people and buildings in anywhere. They are just old historic buildings. The police cars are totally fake. I do not know what the director was trying to show by doing this but it is so stupid. Turkish Police Department never had those cars. I did not see any girls outside in the movie, just men and women with black scarf and covering all their body showed up everywhere. Turkey is a democratic and secular country and there is no difference between people who are walking around the streets live in USA and Turkey. If I knew that I would never go that movie and give money to those f.... people. Please protest this movie and do not watch it even in your house.",
