    "reviewBody": "After seeing the previews, I had already been convinced that I wanted to see This Means War - romantic comedy spy movie - right up my alley. My hubby wasn't similarly convinced.\n\nAfter getting tickets to an advance screening, we both went - and ended up pleasantly surprised. This Means War was funny, really funny - Chelsea Handler was the hidden gem of the movie.\n\nThe movie never took itself too seriously, which was refreshing - it had a few heartfelt moments, but nothing too sappy.\n\nThere's certainly enough action to keep the guys interested, with enough story to keep us gals entertained. And plenty of laughs for everyone.",
