Then you will enjoy The Boy and Heron. It isn't the strongest of Hayao Miyazaki and Ghibli films but a very good addition to their filmography.\n\nThe film begins with a slow pace of mostly visually defining the world, characters and their dilemmas. As the movie progresses you see touches of another realm. Before you know it, it becomes a full-blown feverish dream of Hayao Miyazaki imagination and story telling. It eventually comes all together back on its feet at the end.\n\nWas it fun and visually pleasing? Yes.\n\nWas I confused at times And had a lot of unanswered question? Also yes.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "actor": [{"name": "Soma Santoki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13177683/"}, {"name": "Masaki Suda", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4027243/"}, {"name": "K\u00f4 Shibasaki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0793069/"}], "director": [{"name": "Hayao Miyazaki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Hayao Miyazaki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0594503/"}]}
