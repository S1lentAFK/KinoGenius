The best part of this film is its screenplay. Heather McGowen and Niels Mueller did an wonderful job putting this story together. If you are looking for a film that knows how to develop its characters, build suspense and most importantly can tell a story the way it is meant to be told, then you need to see Tadpole. The acting in this film was also excellent. Bebe Neuwirth, John Ritter and Aaron Stanford gave great performances. This is a funny and touching film that anyone that is a fan of a good screenplay will enjoy.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 10}}, "actor": [{"name": "Sigourney Weaver", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000244/"}, {"name": "Aaron Stanford", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0822155/"}, {"name": "Kate Mara", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0544718/"}], "director": [{"name": "Gary Winick", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935095/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Heather McGowan", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0569641/"}, {"name": "Niels Mueller", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007158/"}, {"name": "Gary Winick", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0935095/"}]}
