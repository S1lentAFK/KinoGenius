So it suddenly becomes a thriller, there's drama added to a genuinely moving story and characters, and it seems to rush towards its ending unprepared. But that's the whole postmodern element of the film - is it deliberately bad and pat (like the Player - a much lesser film that doesn't stand up after repeated viewing)?\n\nAnyway, Cage is fantastic in this - really if the Oscars were about acting, he should have got it for articulating two characters brilliantly. After the mess of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, it's some achievement.\n\n A must see - but you need to engage your brain for this!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 201832, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.7}}
