Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "director": [{"name": "Chris Wedge", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0917188/"}, {"name": "Carlos Saldanha", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0757858/"}], "actor": [{"name": "Denis Leary", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001459/"}, {"name": "John Leguizamo", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000491/"}, {"name": "Ray Romano", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005380/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Michael J.
