The film is well-paced and the camera work is slick. The film does well in exploring the confines of the house. Jodie Foster is effective and maintains a high intensity throughout. Kristen Stewart is decent as her daughter. Forest Whitaker plays a slightly sympathetic criminal and does well. Unfortunately, after an engrossing game of cat and mouse, the conclusion is weak. Staple clich\u00e9s crop up and the film goes for a crowd-pleasing finale that doesn't quite feel right. Still watchable.\n\nOverall 7/10", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 295027, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.8}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "datePublished": "2002-05-03", "keywords": "panic,panic room,cat and mouse,secret room,female protagonist", "duration": "PT1H52M", "actor": [{"name": "Jodie Foster", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000149/"}, {"name": "Kristen Stewart", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576/"}, {"name": "Forest Whitaker", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001845/"}], "director": [{"name": "David Fincher", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000399/"}], "creator": [{"name": "David Koepp", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0462895/"}]}
