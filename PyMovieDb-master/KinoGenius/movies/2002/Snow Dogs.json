The movie was completely predictable, but that didn't make it any less fun for me. I've never read the book it was based off of, but as for the movie itself, my wife and I greatly enjoyed seeing it. We could use more family films where the main purpose in going to see it is to be entertained and nothing more.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 28457, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.2}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "datePublished": "2002-05-31", "keywords": ["husky", "fish out of water", "nightmare", "slimehouse", "snow adventure"], "duration": "PT1H39M", "actor": [{"name": "Cuba Gooding Jr.", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000421/"}, {"name": "James Coburn", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000336/"}, {"name": "Sisq\u00f3", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005437/"}], "director": [{"name": "Brian Levant", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505152/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Jim Kouf", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0467942/"}, {"name": "Tommy Swerdlow", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842476/"}, {"name": "Michael Goldberg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0325271/"}]}
