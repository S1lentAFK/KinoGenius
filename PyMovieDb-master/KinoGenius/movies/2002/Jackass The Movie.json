It&apos;s dumb, pointless entertainment, and one of the best comedy films around. It&apos;s not edgy and gross for the sake of being edgy and gross, but for the sake of being funny. Which it is. Very funny. It&apos;s cringe-inducing and weird at times, but it&apos;s a classic.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 101701, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}, "contentRating": "18", "genre": ["Documentary", "Action", "Comedy"], "datePublished": "2003-02-28", "keywords": ["disgusting", "immaturity", "vagina", "male nudity", "male frontal nudity"], "duration": "PT1H25M", "actor": [{"name": "Johnny Knoxville", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424216/"}, {"name": "Bam Margera", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0546640/"}, {"name": "Chris Pontius", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690686/"}], "director": [{"name": "Jeff Tremaine", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871860/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Jeff Tremaine", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0871860/"}, {"name": "Spike Jonze", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005069/"}, {"name": "Johnny Knoxville", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424216/"}]}
