It touches on all the basic concerns of humanity: love, race, age, parents, and real estate. More than that, it handles all of them with honesty and kindness.\\n\\nThis movie should be watched late at night when the mind no longer knows where it wants to go. You can let it drift over you like a soft summer breeze. Hopefully in that state you will accept the fact that there is really no graceful resolutions or summations in life, just a review of how we dealt with all the little things which seemed so large at the time. The selection of actors for the movie also reflects the tone. Many very good artists who are drawn from television rather than the box office are able to use this vehicle to show us what they are really capable of.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 10}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 4225, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.8}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Drama", "Romance"], "datePublished": "2002-07-26", "keywords": ["reference to mother courage and her children", "watching tv", "reference to elektra", "landscape architect", "historic cemetery"], "duration": "PT2H21M", "actor": [{"name": "Angela Bassett", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000291/"}, {"name": "Edie Falco", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004908/"}, {"name": "Alex Lewis", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506902/"}], "director": [{"name": "John Sayles", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000626/"}], "creator": [{"name": "John Sayles", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000626/"}]}
