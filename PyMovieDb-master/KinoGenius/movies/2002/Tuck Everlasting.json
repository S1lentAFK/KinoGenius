Tuck Everlasting was such a great film. The acting was great. William Hurt, Ben Kingsley, Sissy Spacek, Jonathan Jackson, Scott Bairstow, Amy Irving, Victor Garbor, Alexis Bledel are excellent in this movie. They are all such good actors/ actresses. The scenery was just beautiful. The music was very very pretty. I never read the book and I know there are probably changes in it from the movie, but as a movie lover I loved ever minute of it. This movie is for everyone. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good Disney movie or just a good family movie.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "actor": [{"name": "Alexis Bledel", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/"}, {"name": "Jonathan Jackson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005044/"}, {"name": "Sissy Spacek", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000651/"}], "director": [{"name": "Jay Russell", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0751221/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Natalie Babbitt", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0044810/"}, {"name": "Jeffrey Lieber", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0509340/"}, {"name": "James V.
