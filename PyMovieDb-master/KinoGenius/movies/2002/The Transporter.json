It starts with a wild car chase in France, introduces some memorable phrases, adds an attractive woman and antagonist with a very bad hair piece. There is also the required explosions and fight scenes, but they are not over-the-top.\n\nThe plot is not spectacular, but hey, it's a guy movie. Jason Statham makes a great tough guy, loved him in The Italian Job as well.\n\nI recommend inviting your friends over, grabbing some Orangina, and watching this great movie.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 319279, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.8}}
