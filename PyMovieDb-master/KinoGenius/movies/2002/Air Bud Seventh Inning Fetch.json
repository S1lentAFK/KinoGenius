If this were set in the future, with maybe some ogres and robot men having a war against a giant Abraham Lincoln wearing a diaper, it would have been entertaining. In its current state, I hardly see how this could entertain its target audience, anybody younger than 6 years old. I watched it with my girlfriend's dad when we were both hungover and our headaches got worse!! This was atrocious, and the actors should be ashamed for having stooped so low as to dignify this movie's creation and release. THE DOG HITS A HOMERUN WITH A BASEBALL BAT IT HOLDS IN ITS MOUTH.
