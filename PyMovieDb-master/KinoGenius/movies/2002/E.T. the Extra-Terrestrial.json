Really cried. Six years later, I still cry at it. The ability of this film to pull emotions out of you is unlike most films we see today.\\n\\nAs many of the users have said, this is a film made for children and it achieves this brilliantly.\\n\\nI do feel as well that it targets adults, returnign them to their innocence. The time of our lives when mothing was impossible and everything had goodness in it. In modern times it is all too often seen that children are desperate to become adults and lose their innocence far too quickly. This story in which S.S developed helps adults to return to that time.\\n\\nI would give this film 11/10. Anyone who feels that it is not heart warming and emotional, I think have been watching a totally different film!!!!!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 434314, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.9}, "contentRating": "U", "genre": ["Adventure", "Family", "Sci-Fi"], "datePublished": "1982-12-10", "keywords": "alien,friendship,extraterrestrial,friendly alien,california", "duration": "PT1H55M", "actor": [{"name": "Henry Thomas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001794/"}, {"name": "Drew Barrymore", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000106/"}, {"name": "Peter Coyote", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001075/"}], "director": [{"name": "Steven Spielberg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Melissa Mathison", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0558953/"}]}
