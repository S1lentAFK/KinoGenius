Last night when we were entering the store, my sister said something about renting ''Cinderella''. I told her that I didn't want to watch ''Cinderella'' AGAIN (i don't think that i could stand hearing another ''bibidi bobidi boo'' for the 3rd time this month) and that we should get something that we hadn't already watched, like that one, ''The Princess and the pea''. She agreed eventually, because she knew I wouldn't stop whining if I didn't have it my way. Well, in the end all my sisters loved the movie. The storyline is very nice and the animation good. Not as good as Disney's but much more than acceptable. All in all ''The Princess and the pea'' is a great movie that should have gained more recognition and is way better than many other big labeled animated features such as ''Shark Tale'' and ''Home on the Range''.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "actor": [{"name": "Liam Aiken", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0014582/"}, {"name": "Forrest S.
