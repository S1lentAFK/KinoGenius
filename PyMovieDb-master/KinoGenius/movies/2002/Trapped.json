Some good setups and payoffs as well (though one involving the waggling of a plane&apos;s wings is kinda corny, but it worked). My only criticism is that some of the dialogue is predictable (the bad guys says exactly what we expect him to say in certain scenes). Courtney Love plays a white trash wench pretty well, but that&apos;s not surprising given her vagabond background.\\n\\nBOTTOMLINE: If you like thrillers, go see this on a matinee -- worth seeing on the big screen for some beautiful cinematography of the Pacific Northwest and the climax. IMHO a big step above ALONG CAME A SPIDER and HIGH CRIMES. I haven&apos;t seen Mandoki&apos;s other flicks, but I plan to rent them now. I just hope Charlize Theron chooses some more challenging dramatic roles, or her career will probably suffer for it.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 25629, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.1}}
