And it turned out I was right.\nThe bad: it is suppose to be horror, but it isnt horrifying for one minute. A bit freaky and strange, but definitely not scary. And I wanna get scared watching such a movie. That is the whole point of making horror movies.\nMore bad: besides a wonderful performance by the ever great Ellen Burstyn, none of the other actors impressed me. The 2 kids, who were possessed were okay, but not terrific either. But the other actors were plain average or even below average.\nDefnitely an insult to the classic original from 1973, which was an absolute shocker of a classic!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 4}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 36143, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 4.8}}
