Only this version is taken place in another universe where ships sail in space and Aliens and Human live in the same community.\n\nJim Hawkin a guy who's about 17, lives with his mom who works at their Inn which is their home. Jim never got to spend much time with his dad since his dad came and go due to whatever job he's in. Jim hasn't made his mom proud for him, specially when he keeps trespassing factories on his Sail Board and getting caught by the police. His mom doesn't want to see her own son sent away to a juvenile hall.\n\nLife seems bad for Jim, till one day a pirate came out of nowhere telling Jim to take an object that a crew of pirates are after. The orb Jim got is a map that shows you the location of Treasure Planet. A tale Jim heard from as a kid is no longer a bedtime story to him. It actual exists and he's determine to go there and be sure he'll make his mom proud for him.\n\nI don't care if many people disliked this movie. But I really enjoyed it. Even if it's one of the PG rated Animated Disney movies.\n\nThe CGI and 2-D animation combined together makes it very visual. It's rated PG only for Action violence, and a few non important characters die. It also has a would be villain and an actual villain in it too.\n\nI recommend it to those who like sci-Fi animated films or those who are into the unique Disney movies. It's something the whole family can enjoy together.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 131548, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.2}, "contentRating": "U", "genre": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Family"], "datePublished": "2003-02-14", "keywords": "space pirate,fictional planet,treasure hunt,wisecrack humor,moon", "duration": "PT1H35M", "actor": [{"name": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687/"}, {"name": "Emma Thompson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000668/"}, {"name": "Martin Short", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001737/"}], "director": [{"name": "Ron Clements", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166256/"}, {"name": "John Musker", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615780/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Robert Louis Stevenson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829044/"}, {"name": "Ron Clements", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0166256/"}, {"name": "John Musker", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615780/"}]}
