    "reviewBody": "The legend of La Llorona is a very interesting story that had potential to become a good movie. Unfortunately, this one suffered from showing the monster too much.\n\nThe plot wasn&apos;t bad. It would have been more interesting if they showed more of how the legend started, but they had a good idea to go with. What really didn&apos;t work for this movie was showing La Llorona too many times, to the point that she wasn&apos;t scary. What&apos;s always creepy in movies like this is not being able to see their face until the very end, which they had a perfect scene to show her, but by then it was too late.\n\nIf you like the Conjuring universe/horror movies, it&apos;s a fun watch, just don&apos;t expect anything special.",
