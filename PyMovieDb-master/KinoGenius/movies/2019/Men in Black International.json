    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll be the first to say that I was concerned when I heard of this incarnation of MIB as the previous trilogy worked so well. This was a fresh approach to a successful concept. There were some slow moments in the beginning I admit that didn&apos;t quite fit in but overall the acting, plot and special effects were good. Go see it with an open mind and this movie stands up solidly with the rest of the franchise.",
