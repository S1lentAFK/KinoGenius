    "reviewBody": "I am confused by all the negative ratings. I think anyone who has experienced true heart break can appreciate this movie. This film showcased a beautiful love, the ups and downs, the hardships and choices that happen when two people share their love together, and then ultimately, the end. No it isn&apos;t your typically happy ending film, but the love between these two was special, and the relationship between these three girls, well it&apos;s what we all want. People in our corner, who support us, and hold us up when we need it.",
