    "reviewBody": "I hate romcoms, I find them shallow and boring. I&apos;m not a big Rogan fan either. However, moderately enjoyed this one.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t great, but the jokes worked and didn&apos;t work too hard to get a chuckle. There was a bit of preaching about ideologies, but it was necessary for some of the jokes and plot to play. The climax (literally) gag was a bit unexpected, but it, again, wasn&apos;t gratuitous once the point was made. Overall, I liked it.",
