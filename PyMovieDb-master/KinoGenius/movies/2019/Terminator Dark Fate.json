    "reviewBody": "Great action scenes. And the rest is pathetic. The new terminator made a few jokes. - really? The latino girl character is SO dull and such a cliche. I am so disappointed. This is nothing like T1 and T2. When you have all the tools and resources to make it work and all you do is produce this FAILURE. SHAME!",
