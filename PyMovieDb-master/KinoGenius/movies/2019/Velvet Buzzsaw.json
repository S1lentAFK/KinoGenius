    "reviewBody": "After Nightcrawler Dan Gilroy is a figure that I will permanently be interested in. Then came along Roman J Israel which was a frustrating experience. There was a lot of good in it but it seemed to relish being slow and unnecessarily wordy. Now we have Velvet Buzzsaw. A movie so plain, I had absolutely no response to. There is barely enough here to be upset about and nearly nothing to be wowed by. It&apos;s just so...bland. You&apos;d think Jake gyllenhaal would be the main character but he isn&apos;t. In fact, no one is. It&apos;s Totally confused, strangely muddled, and tonally messy. It was almost as if the film was passing through my head as soon as it went in.",
