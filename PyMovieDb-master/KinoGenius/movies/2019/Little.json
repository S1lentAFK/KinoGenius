    "reviewBody": "Greta has made me feel nostalgic for a feeling I cannot express. Little Women transported me back to a state of expression I&apos;ve been meaning to express for quite a while. With Jo and her will to excel through life and love, I seek to gather all my strength in rowing my boat with time and love by my side. For life&apos;s too short to be angry about things that haven&apos;t gone your way. There&apos;s only a path forward, connections made with time and people living their lives, but out of all, you&apos;re living yours, as of now, and the best you can do is, be yourself, unapologetically, forever. That&apos;s what Little Women has instilled in me, toward the end. It sure is a beautiful rendition, a promising take on an everlasting classic.",
