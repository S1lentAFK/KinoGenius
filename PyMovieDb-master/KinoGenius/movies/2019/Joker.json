    "reviewBody": "Arthur Fleck&apos;s a guy with lofty aspirations, wants to make you laugh and disturb your foundations, although, he&apos;s not really that funny, he ain&apos;t going to make much money, so before you start, curtail your expectations; unlike Arthur, you won&apos;t be having laughing fits, as he aspires to get some television glitz, dispatches tormentors with glee, it&apos;s a substantial, hefty fee, but I guarantee, it won&apos;t leave you in bits; although, if schadenfreude&apos;s your thing you might just chuckle, but if it&apos;s not, the story may just make you buckle, as those on, the lower rungs, tend to not have, that much fun, and quite often, from the day they learned to suckle.",
