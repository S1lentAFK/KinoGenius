    "reviewBody": "A good, nay great, movie version to the classic 60s series. Raul Julia is great as Gomez, as is Christopher Lloyd as Fester. The story is sound, pretty much better than the sequel. This is a comedy with slightly dark themes, but that doesn&apos;t mean the family can not enjoy it. Barry Sonnenfeld is a genius.",
