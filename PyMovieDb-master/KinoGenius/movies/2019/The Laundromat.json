    "reviewBody": "Yes, the message comes across loud and clear about the dilemma of fraudulent insurance scams, tax evasions and shell companies, but the storytelling is haphazard, disjointed and feeble at best. The stellar cast cannot save what the writing is messing up, this is a missed opportunity of telling (what could have been) a much better story about a dark element of today American corporate life (which Mr. Trump clearly play a role in as well...).",
