    "reviewBody": "Comedy and horror, it&apos;s always a delicate genre with not alot of good movies. Satanic Panic is just under the good movies in this genre, it&apos;s worth watching once but I don&apos;t need to watch it again in the future. The horror parts were actually the funniest parts to me, with a decent amount of well done but funny gore. The cast wasn&apos;t bad either, no future Oscar winners here but not cringing to watch either. The title for this movie resumes it all, it&apos;s just a bit of fun and horror.",
