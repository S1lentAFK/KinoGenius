    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve never read the books but that didn&apos;t seem essential to enjoy the movie. A few scary moments but very predictable for most horror fans. However, I think its quite good for its target audience, early teens making the first steps into horror movies. I&apos;ll definitely watch it again with my kids when they are a little older.",
