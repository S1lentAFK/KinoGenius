    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a quirky and fun movie, and the vacuum presentation was probably the funniest part. It&apos;s kind of a weird movie about a girl dealing with real world problems in an unbelievably ridiculous way. Great performances, but very little substance to the story line. Very cool set designs and costuming.",
