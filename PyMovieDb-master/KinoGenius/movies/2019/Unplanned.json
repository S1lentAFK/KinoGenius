    "reviewBody": "Before seeing this movie I noticed that the majority of people tended towards giving it one star or ten stars. I perused the one star ratings and noted that many indicated that the acting was very poor. Since that has often historically been the case with Christian productions, I thought it might be so. I went to see the movie and can honestly say that the acting was fine and the story gripping, compelling, possibly life changing. I am pro-life. If I had not been and if I had much humanity in me at all I would likely be pro-life after watching this movie. I hope and pray that many who might someday have an abortion would see this movie first.",
