    "reviewBody": "..this was a pleasure to watch. Two exceptional performances which were genuinely deeply moving, framed expertly within the context of the fairly recent selection of the Pope(s). Funny at times and also eye opening as an eduction in traditions and dogma V modernisation and reform of the Catholic Church. Whether you have faith or none at all, this is a truly heart warming, non-sentimental journey in the company of two of Britain&apos;s finest actors.",
