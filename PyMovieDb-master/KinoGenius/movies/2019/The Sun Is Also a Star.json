    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s about family, love, and following your hearts desire. The storyline and education of immigrants in America was relevant. Both Jamaican American and Asian American cultures were represented in a beautiful way. The chemistry between Yara and Charles was palpable. The city of New York was the third love of this film. Do yourself a favor, support the young artists. Buy a ticket. You won&apos;t be disappointed.",
