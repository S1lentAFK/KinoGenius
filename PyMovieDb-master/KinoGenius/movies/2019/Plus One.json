    "reviewBody": "This is a great summer movie! Funny, romantic, and fresh in its approach to a genre that&apos;s making a comeback. It&apos;s drawn many comparisons to When Harry Met Sally, as friendship is a key part of the romance (which makes the build that much more tension filled!). Maya Erskine and Jack Quaid have great chemistry and Erskine is especially funny.",
