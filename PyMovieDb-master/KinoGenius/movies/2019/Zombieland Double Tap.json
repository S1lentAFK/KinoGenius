    "reviewBody": "Not as fresh and funny as the first one but still funny enough. Good cast (you can see and feel that they got a lot of fun making the movie), good production, here and there a nice gore effect - in short: Double Tap is a solid sequel with some fine moments and good if you are into zombie comedy",
