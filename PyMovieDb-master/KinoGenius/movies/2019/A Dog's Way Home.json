    "reviewBody": "My kids have been tracking this movie for weeks and I had promised to bring them all (3 daughters all under 12.)\n\nYes, this is the same story told again (Homeward Bound and it&apos;s various sequels), however it&apos;s a little different. The animals are animals, and they don&apos;t talk, however the main dog (Bella) does tell the story from her point of view.\n\nThere are some areas where they replaced animals with CGI and some of it looks really good, but really fake, but 1- my kids didn&apos;t notice all that much, and 2- it&apos;s a movie... Let&apos;s just turn off our minds for about 2 hours and just watch a wholesome family movie.\n\nThere were a number of crying kids, and even some of the adults walked out with some tears, so be prepared.\n\nOverall it&apos;s a really cute, adventurous, and fun movie! Perfect no, but it&apos;s still great!",
