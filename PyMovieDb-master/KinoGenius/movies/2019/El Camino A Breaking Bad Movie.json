    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s sad to see the amount of people disappointed in this movie. I understand this is all subjective put personally I thought the movie was incredible. It was the perfect epilogue to the series and completed Jesse&apos;s story in such a satisfying way. It&apos;s the closure we as the audience could only desire, and more than a tribute to the series. So please, realize that this was never meant to be what Endgame was for the MCU, with crazy SFX and action non-stop, but rather Gilligan&apos;s masterpiece being fully finished.\n\nFelina was the wrapping paper, this is the ribbon.",
