    "reviewBody": "I went to the theatre to watch this just to keep my family company. I expected to be bored for an hour and a half. This is not an epic movie with an epic story. Doesn&apos;t have award winning roles or a genius comedy. But it has such a good vibe to it and somewhat of a lesson to be learned for both youngsters and the elderly. I had to give it a good rating. I enjoyed this way more than I ever thought.",
