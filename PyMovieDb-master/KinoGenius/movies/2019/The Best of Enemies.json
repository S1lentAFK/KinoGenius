    "reviewBody": "I was expecting something like hidden figures or the help. But it wasn&apos;t. Maybe because the story isn&apos;t told but showed. I disagree with previous reviews who say that the class struggle of Ellis or his struggle with the clan&apos;s hypocrisy is ignored. It isn&apos;t talked about but the outstanding performance of Rockwell doesn&apos;t need talk, with one look he says more than with a Shakespeare monologue. The setting created by Bissel speaks for itself too. Beautifull story that left me in tears of joy.",
