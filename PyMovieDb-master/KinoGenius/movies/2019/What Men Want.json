    "reviewBody": "Honestly this was rubbish\n\nI can&apos;t think of one redeeming feature of it ?\n\nThe script was awful full of stereotypes and cliches . Full of thinly disguised racism , homophobia , sexism and misogyny\n\nThis was no female version of Jerry McGuire yet it could have been - it could have been a film about female empowerment against a backdrop of male dominated sports agencies .\n\nThe sex scenes were embarrassing and diabolical . There was little of any humour and as soon as she received her inevitable knock on the head you wished you&apos;d also been knocked out and woke up in a different film !\n\nIf this was television , netflix or Prime you&apos;d stop it or switch channels - unfortunately it&apos;s cinema so you feel compelled to stay to the end , sadly I couldn&apos;t I tried but in the end I had to walk out . I tried to stay till the end but it was just so flat .\n\nIt&apos;s so sad that films like this get distributed when there are so many other worthy films out there that never the exposure .\n\nYou have been warned !\n\nRubbish 2/10 Pad.A",
