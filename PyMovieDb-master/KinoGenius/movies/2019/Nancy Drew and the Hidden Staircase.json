    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m really happy to see a kid&apos;s movie without foul-mouthed, angry, rebellious teens meant to shock & offend people. This stayed in the spirit of the original stories which I loved as a kid. They had to modernize it of course, but it&apos;s wonderful that they kept the girl detective at the heart of it, they didn&apos;t turn her into a witch, make her chase zombies or vampires. If they do any more I hope they stick with this formula.",
