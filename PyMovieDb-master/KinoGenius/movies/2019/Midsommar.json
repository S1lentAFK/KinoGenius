    "reviewBody": "Since I&apos;m swedish I found this really funny and absurd, the wierd traditions were obviously inspired from The Wickerman more than the actual swedish tradition, Midsommar. I&apos;m also really glad I watched it in my home and not at the cinema with other people, because there were scenes I laughed at and I didn&apos;t want to laugh at scenes with others, becuase it wasn&apos;t really funny. I coudn&apos;t help laughing, but at the same time feel really uncomfortable. I enjoyed this movie a lot, every scene made me intrigued and dumbfounded. Sry about the spelling and what not, first rating an all.",
