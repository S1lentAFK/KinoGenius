    "reviewBody": "The reviews I read only gave me the impression that this would be a decent thriller, not...this. After watching one generic blockbuster after another, it&apos;s always so nice to see small, creative films like I Am Mother are still getting made. I&apos;m really curious about how much did this film cost, because it looks really impressive, but I also have the feeling that it has a very small budget. This films has solid acting and interesting characters, it touches on complicated ideas with a tightly paced narrative from start to finish and managed to keep me on the edge of my sit till the very end. If you love to treat yourself with some great science fiction, I highly recommend I Am Mother.",
