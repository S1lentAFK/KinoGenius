    "reviewBody": "Was lucky enough to see the premiere of The Kitchen tonight at BFI film festival and I was not disappointed. This was a great concept for a film, with a great script.\n\nThe casting was also spot on, it was good to see Kane Robinson&apos;s acting skills away from Top Boy and must say he was fantastic as was Hope Ikpoku jnr.\n\nThe locations and settings were perfect, really authentic and believable. Some of the estate had the shape and feel to the Le Vele (Sails) estate, which is just outside Naples in southern Italy, used for the Gomorrah series.\n\nHats off to the director and producers very well done to all involved.",
