    "reviewBody": "Not quite as bad as i thought it would be, Terminator: Genisys brings back the nostalgia of the first two films. It even has the same old-school vibe to it. But when you get to its core, Genisys is simply a rehash of the first two masterpieces, which are so good there was no point in revisiting them.",
