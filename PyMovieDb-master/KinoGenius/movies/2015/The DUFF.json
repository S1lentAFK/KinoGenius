    "reviewBody": "Without the chemistry btw its two leads, this movie would not have worked. Plus, the supporting cast of adults helped. This movie was better than it had any right to be.\\n\\nWhitman has always been a talented actress. I look forward to her eventually getting some truly meaty movie roles.",
