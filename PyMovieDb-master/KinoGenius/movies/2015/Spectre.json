    "heading": "Slightly disappointing but still really good",
    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s overly long, the pacing slows down too much in the second act and Christoph Waltz is massively underutilized but Spectre is still a really good Bond film that&apos;s thrilling, fun and epic whilst also being a more classical Bond film.\n\nDaniel Craig is reliably perfect once again but with more charisma and a lot more quips compared to his previous films. L\u00e9a Seydoux, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Dave Bautista and Ben Whishaw are all great.\n\nSam Mendes&apos; direction is excellent, it&apos;s beautifully filmed and consistently stylish with extremely well filmed action sequences. The music by Thomas Newman is fantastic and the song by Sam Smith is also great.",
