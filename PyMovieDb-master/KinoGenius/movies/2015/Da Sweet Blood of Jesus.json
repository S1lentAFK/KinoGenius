    "reviewBody": "Spike Lee is one of my biggest favorite directors so I was interested in watching this regardless of the low rating\\n\\nAnd I wanted to like it I really did, the opening shot is amazing it has some superb break-dancers break dancing outside to a smooth Bruce Hornsby piano score, looks beautiful\\n\\nBut that montage really has nothing to do with the movie itself, the movie is about an upper class arts collector who by some circumstances get a thirst for blood\\n\\nMind you, if you&apos;re expecting a typical vampire horror you will probably be let down it&apos;s not really that type of movie\\n\\nWhat type of movie it is though I can&apos;t really describe, it&apos;s just a peculiar movie that I had a hard time figuring out what it was trying to be and what it was trying to say\\n\\nThe dialogue is not bad but more-part of it doesn&apos;t sound realistic to what a person would say, often sounding more like theatre monologues basically\\n\\nActing overall is pretty wooden (but that could be an intentional thing being that the people in it are very posh) and pace very slow\\n\\nIt has some above average scenes separately but together it just doesn&apos;t get it&apos;s right flow and your often sitting wondering why or wondering what the point of it all is, and by the end of the movie (at least I) still have no idea\\n\\nFor the record I have not seen the movie GANJA & HESS of which this movie is a remake on, perhaps I would understand this movie better if I&apos;d do that but if one has to watch something else to understand the movie you were watching than that would mean that this movie failed IMO\\n\\nHonestly it felt like Spike Lee didn&apos;t put his whole heart into this project which is a shame, since it was funded by his biggest fans via a Kickstarter campaign",
