    "reviewBody": "I recently watched this movie and really liked it !! This movie is so much better than other new, cool movies !! It's not just about sex and brutality ! And not just a doggy family adventure movie !! It has serious content !! How an animal (dog) can change a person's life Not a perfect movie! There are mistakes!! BUT let's look at its content and not just for kids !! One of the most significant movies I have ever seen for me !! I recommend anyone to watch and not just watch brutal, scary, horrible movies !! Such a movie is much more valuable than other famous big movies !\n\n+I'm sorry about the second part\uD83D\uDE25\uD83D\uDE25 The real is family adventure movie with no more content !! I was expecting more from a MAX 2 !!",
