    "reviewBody": "The film is derivative, as well as whitewashed. \n\nThere are so many factual goofs, when it comes to clothes, music, etc. The filmmaker needed to spend some time doing research and fact checking. \n\nI also find fault with the film centering around a kid from Kansas. The uprising was started by Puerto Rican and African American drag queens, and there is strong support that the first police resistance was by a lesbian, not some white football player from the mid-west.\n\nI suggest watching the British 1997 film, which really feels so much more authentic.",
