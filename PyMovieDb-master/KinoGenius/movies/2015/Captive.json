    "reviewBody": "Captive State is a sci-fi movie directed by Ruper Wyatt who decides to take it easy and tell a completely different story than the typical Hollywood blockbuster. It is in this decision where the film gains strength. But let's be clear, Captive State is not a perfect movie, far from it. But it is an extremely imaginative film, with such intriguing concepts as revolution and aliens. It is a master class that explains how a revolutionary cell operates in a fictitious situation and gives us a thriller that makes us tense at times and intrigues us in others. Despite not having fully explored characters, the film builds an intriguing world with well-shot scenes and an ending that will leave you glued to your seat and asking for more. Captive State is not perfect, but it is definitely a recommendation.",
