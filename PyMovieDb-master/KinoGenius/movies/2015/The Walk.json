    "reviewBody": "Robert Zemeckis continue&apos;s to be of the best director&apos;s in Hollywood. He has made a beautiful movie and even though you know what happens, he keeps you gripping your armrests and holding your breath until the very end. Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines in this role along with the rest of the cast.\\n\\nI suppose this review is also for the people who were in New York during 9/11. As a survivor of 9/11, I couldn&apos;t help but cry at the end of the movie. Seeing the Twin Towers rising in all their glory, basking in the sunset and reminding us of their beauty that so many of us took for granted, brought back so many emotions for me. They were like old friends saying hello and goodbye one last time.\\n\\nThank you Zemeckis for telling a great story, making a beautiful movie and bringing back old friends to life!\\n\\nIf possible, go see it in IMAX! You won&apos;t regret it!",
