    "reviewBody": "One of the best films of a generation, it's a bold claim, but Gladiator truly is that good. Every single element is perfect, the story is phenomenal, one to absorb you for the full running time. The visuals are incredible, an epic masterpiece for the eyes as well as the soul. The acting first rate, surely the aim of any film is to move you, this does just that and then some.\n\nThe best of Russell Crow are far as I'm concerned, he really does command the screen throughout, Joaquin Phoenix is just as good, it makes me so sad that this was the last film of the late great Oliver Reed, and of course he's awesome.\n\nI must also comment on the incredible soundtrack, the sublime music of Has Zimmer coupled with the ancient, enchanting voice of Lisa Gerrard, the music is the same glorious standard as the film, Now we are free still gives me chills, and takes me back to the film.\n\nOne of my top ten films of all time, a masterpiece, 10/10.",
