    "reviewBody": "I've loved all things concerning vampires since the first time I saw The Lost Boys. (Obviously not an Oscar-worthy film, but it certainly is entertaining.) When I saw previews for The Little Vampire, I must admit that I thought it looked really, really bad. I had the opportunity to watch it a few days ago and was pleasantly surprised by the film. I was impressed by the special effects, especially Rudolph's bat form. The cows were an interesting addition, too. I loved the costumes and makeup. The story and plot weren't all that original and were very predictable, but I think kids from 6 to 12 would enjoy those aspects of the film. I thought Rollo Weeks and the actress who played his sister, Anna, were terrific and I hope to see them both in more films. Jonathan Lipnicki was cute, but is that kid ever going to grow? Sheesh, he'll look 6 when graduates from college. I liked most of the adult characters, especially the vampire parents. I've seen Richard E. Grant and Alice Krige both in other movies and I enjoyed their performances. I would give this movie a 7 out of 10. It's fun to watch and only a little bit too cutesy.",
