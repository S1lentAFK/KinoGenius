    "reviewBody": "I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn&apos;t really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day. I give X-men 2000 10/10 stars, For its good story and how they put such good casting in this movie.",
