    "reviewBody": "This is a film that will delight viewers time and time again.\n\nIt's terrific family entertainment that isn't afraid to venture into darker territory. There are carnivorous dinosaurs chasing herbivores and a giant asteroid that crashes towards earth. As tense as these scenes can be, it's okay. This is a Disney film that shows us in the end we can get through things by sticking together. Ultimately I feel that is the moral of this film and it's a good one.\n\nThe music by James Newton Howard happens to be one of his best. It's beautiful and adventurous with themes that evoke a sense of wonder.\n\nThe look of the film is fantastic. The dinosaurs look quite real and the scenery is nothing short of breathtaking.\n\nIt's a film that contains all the right elements for a family masterpiece. Perhaps, my only wish is that it was a bit longer, but it is what it is and I am more than happy with it. It's a film that earns it's place along the great Disney classics such as The Lion King, Toy Story, Mary Poppins, and all the other classics.\n\nBravo Disney!",
