    "reviewBody": "Always on Daytime Sky movies, terrible plot, awful wooden acting. Was watching this while decorating, and being truthful, was difficult to decide whether this or the paint was more interesting to watch.\n\nAVOID AVOID AVOID. \n\nI do not understand why there are now three versions of this primate film, and why SKY seem it important enough to show all of these, most weekdays, several times a day.\n\nPerhaps it was because they got them on discount.\n\nPlease vote with your feet and get sky and other companies to take this dross off our screens.",
