    "reviewBody": "This movie desperately needed better screenplay and better ending to it.Fair black comedy though becouse of the great cast and the powers of Travolta and Kudrow.Unfairly cut down by many critics.It is worth a watch as long as you do not expect a classic which I&apos;m sure most knowledgable movie goers will not.The director shoud have made it more underground and less mainstream given the style chosen to do this film.......",
