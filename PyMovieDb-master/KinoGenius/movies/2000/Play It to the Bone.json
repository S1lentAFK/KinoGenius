    "reviewBody": "I just saw this movie the other day and, unlike some reviewers, I had a problem with the fight scenes. I thought they were too unrealistic.\\n\\nFirst off, let me say that I loved the celebrity cameos at the arena; they certainly added a touch of realism, and having Lucy Liu&apos;s character show up with Rod Stewart was a stroke of genius. But I thought it too unrealistic the way the two boxers slugged each other without lingering effect. How many times did one of them get knocked down and struggle to barely get up at the count of nine? Too many to count. And in real boxing matches, whenever someone struggles to get up at the count of nine, it is all they can do just to hang on until the end of the round. Yet in this movie, each time someone gets up at the count of nine they immediately launch a counteroffensive that has their opponents on the ropes. They just does not happen in real life.\\n\\nAm I nitpicking? Perhaps, but it ruined the film for me.",
