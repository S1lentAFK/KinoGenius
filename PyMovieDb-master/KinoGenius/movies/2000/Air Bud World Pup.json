    "reviewBody": "I saw this one afternoon on one of the movie channels. I was dubious at first after reading the synopsis on my remote control, but I kept watching and was pleasantly surprised. OK it didn't have an a-list cast but the acting was bearable. \n\nOK it was about a dog playing football and saving the winning penalty. But it is a kids film, meant for children to entertain and amuse, and it entertained me and had its few giggling moments. \n\nI have seen a couple of the 'Air Bud' movies and this is by far the best one. Its easy viewing and kills a few hours. Something to stick the kids in front of, just make sure during the credits you don't hear 'I want a dog!'",
