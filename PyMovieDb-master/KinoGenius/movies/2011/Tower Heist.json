    "reviewBody": "Tower Heist is Ben Stiller&apos;s latest comedy where he plays the building manager of a New York high rise tower block. He regrettably invests him and his staff&apos;s pension money with a smooth-talking crook who lives in the top floor penthouse. Naturally, the crook wastes their money and they&apos;re left without a cent.\\n\\nTherefore, Ben and a few other disgruntled employees, enlist the help of small time crook Eddie Murphy to break into the penthouse and steal back their money.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a decent enough premise and, again, all the cast to a decent enough job. There you have it - it&apos;s a decent film. Not quite funny enough to be a comedy through and through. Not quite dramatic enough to be a straight drama. It even throws in a bit of a high speed car chase into the mix to add an element of &apos;action&apos; into the genre.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a bit of a mixed bag. If you go into it without any expectations, you should find it an okay watch.\\n\\nNot great, but not bad either. Fans of Stiller and Murphy should find extra things to enjoy about it.",
