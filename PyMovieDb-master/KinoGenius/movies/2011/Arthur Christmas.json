    "reviewBody": "Okay for me, it was simple but perfection! Simple storyline, great animation, great characters! This movie is what Children Animation should be like! The movie was not bad and it also had a nice theme to it. The bad guys weren't to violent or vicious like other children animation. But if you think about it there were not really any bad guys at all. There were only a few violent moments (explosion of 'Eve') and I thought at one moment the older brother was going to do something bad but it kept to the innocence. Great movie for young kids and older viewers looking for a calm, fun night to enjoy! Great work to everyone who were involved.",
