    "reviewBody": "Heartwarming family movie that's very sweet and inspirational. If this movie doesn't make you smile, I feel sorry for you. Yes, it's predictable if you're an older viewer but that's not always a bad thing. It's based on a true story about this dolphin who loses her tail and the efforts to give her a prosthetic tail that might enable her to swim normally. They add some fictional elements to the movie for dramatic effect but nothing too corny. It's got a good cast and a good story with a lot of heart. The little girl Cozi Zuehlsdorff is especially adorable. It's a really nice movie with a hopeful message. It's a dolphin movie, people. Who doesn't like dolphins?",
