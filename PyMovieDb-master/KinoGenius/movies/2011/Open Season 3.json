    "reviewBody": "Why does everyone think that kids are stupid or they can't actually spot a poorly made movie. I watched Open Season 1 and 2 before. IMO they were fine children movies. Now, I have seen some weak animations before but this really surprised me.\\n\\nI tried to laugh in this movie but I think my hand was busy facepalming. In short, I regretted watching this movie. I thought maybe they will end with a bang and I would get some fond memories out of it, but no, they just ruined all the magic and probably made me hate this trilogy.\\n\\nUnless you're a slow kid or just love these characters, I would recommend you avoid this movie. Watch something else or try watching something from the past.\\n\\nTL;DR, Life is short, don't waste it on this one.",
