    "reviewBody": "I usually get my movies from the public library where the pickings can be slim, so when I get the chance to grab a movie starring Robert Duval I don't pass it up. It is hard to believe he has won only one Oscar. Once again, as in The Disciple, among others, Mr. Duval appears among a stellar ensemble who don't appear to be stars at all, just natural actors. The story centers around Lucas Black's character, a young golfer, and the ranch(Utopia)run by Duval he goes to for reflection/meditation after a devastating loss. While there he meets the locals and receives life lessons from ex-golfer Duval. Prior to picking up the film I didn't pay attention to it's G rating; it was a Duval film so I didn't care. All the actors are superb and their characters true and interesting. The ending is a surprise. Watch it. By the way, Lucas Black is a super actor. I had a hard time placing him at first; his accent kept nagging at me. Then I realized it was the kid from Sling Blade all grown up. He turned out to be a good looking guy with a natural talent and charm. I highly recommend this film although as I said I was not really prepared for the ending.",
