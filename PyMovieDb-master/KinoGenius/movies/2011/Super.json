    "reviewBody": "It is hard to rate independent/alternative films, because although I&apos;d give this one a 10/10, it would seem unfair to put it beside movie classics. On the other hand, I totally enjoyed every second of it. The story is both bizarre and great, Rainn Wilson delivers a strangely adorable performance, and the film as a whole is original and brilliant. A cult film and definitely one of my all time favorites.",
