    "reviewBody": "I went to see One Day last night, and though I had been looking forward to it for a while, I was surprised at how good it actually is. \\n\\nThe film has a very unique atmosphere, as it is much quirkier than your average romance. Also, without giving away the ending, I can say that it isn&apos;t as predictable as one might think. What I really liked about it was the complexity of the different human relationships that we are shown. The relationship between Emma and Dexter is by no means an easy one, nor is it one-sided. Given how different they are, there is a lot of conflict between them, although they do love each other. Similarly, what Dexter and his ex-wife feel for one another is never pure hatred, but there is a lot of understanding between them. As a consequence, the story seems like it could be taken from real life. \\n\\nPlus, both Hathaway and Sturgess are as convincing as always, which makes this film absolutely worth seeing.",
