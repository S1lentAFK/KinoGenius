    "reviewBody": "Seen this now, i don't know why, I have been avoiding this one over the year. I was expecting it to be really dull and boring movie..\n\nIt was not as boring as I thought it was going to be, well start of slow like all the other found footage movies then gets going before the half hour mark.\n\nI found really enjoyable for most of part of the movie, there was decent amount of Jumps scene in this movie. some jumps scene worked and some missed the mark a little.\n\nThe acting was really good from small cast crew, the ending was really predicable.\n\nAs I had low expectation of this movie, I found it much better then thought it was going be, not one of best Found footage movies, Decent movie for this genre 5 out of 10",
