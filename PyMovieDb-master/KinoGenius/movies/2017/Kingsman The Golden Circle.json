    "reviewBody": "Read to the end to see my updated thoughts.\n\n&apos;Kingsman: The Golden Circle (2017)&apos; is essentially all a big joke played on those who took umbrage at the few select sexualised moments from the final act of the first film, a joke whereby everything is consistently ramped up to eleven regardless of its negative impact on the story. This standoffish move is meant to further separate the apparent &apos;critics&apos; from the so-called &apos;fans&apos;, yet it only successfully provides both categories with a much worse experience. While I and many other &apos;fans&apos; didn&apos;t mind (or at least excused) the passive, clearly satirical crude jests and occasional absurdity of the original picture, we certainly didn&apos;t want a follow-up based entirely around what would obviously be considered the weakest aspects of that piece - elements which were only mitigated by the joyous fun found in the brilliance of its subtle yet witty satire and its surprisingly well-developed characters. These pieces of the puzzle are now missing. Though this picture is, at times, passively entertaining, what we&apos;re left with is a fairly by-the-numbers &apos;save the world&apos; plot and a string of odd action set-pieces seemingly incompetently put together. There&apos;s abhorrent use of rampant speed ramping that makes things literally look like someone hit the fast-forward button, and haphazardly stitched-together short takes that are supposed to make some sequences look like one fluid shot but instead make them look like cheap cartoons. In his quest to ignore the naysayers, Vaughn disappointingly squanders all of the good will he had built with his predecessor and bizarrely wipes the slate clean relatively early on, wasting time setting up a less interesting new set of characters instead of working with the better characters already expertly established at the end of the prior title. He also reintroduces a previously dead character (seen in the trailers), after making him an amnesiac no less, in a move that should be reserved only for a waning franchise at least five films in that&apos;s struggling to maintain its relevancy, not for what was once perhaps the most promising new property in Hollywood.\n\nAfter revisiting this recently, I can safely say that it&apos;s far more fun than I originally gave it credit for. Perhaps it&apos;s because my expectations were on the floor, but I really enjoyed the film this time around. Its narrative issues are still present but somehow far less bothersome, while its action is actually really well-achieved for the most part. It leans into its ridiculousness and knows exactly what it is. It&apos;s actually a lot of fun. I guess I have to eat the words of my original review (which I&apos;ll leave above for posterity&apos;s sake), but I gladly will; after all, who doesn&apos;t want to enjoy a movie? 7/10.",
