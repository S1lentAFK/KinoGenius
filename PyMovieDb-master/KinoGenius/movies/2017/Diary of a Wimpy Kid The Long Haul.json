    "reviewBody": "After the third installment, everyone was satisfied with the entire trilogy as a whole. They were all nostalgic, and no-one really cared to see another film in the series because of how perfect it ended. But then this movie came along. They casted a young kid to play Greg, Rodrick's character was ruined, and the whole plot was just weird. And I actually liked the book version of this movie, but the aspects the movie added were terrible.",
