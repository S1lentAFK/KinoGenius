    "reviewBody": "Loved it so much, I had to watch it twice this week! I found it especially impressive because the focus was not on religiosity, but rather on spiritual growth through a tragedy. It&apos;s similar to NDEs (near-death experiences) which seem always to focus on spiritual growth-not religion; each one a vastly different and very personal experience. This movie follows that pattern. It&apos;s very warm-hearted, very thought-provoking. The acting was gentle, not dynamic which is only reason I rated it 8. Otherwise, a 10.",
