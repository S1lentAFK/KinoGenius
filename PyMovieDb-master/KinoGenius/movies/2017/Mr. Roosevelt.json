    "reviewBody": "I went into this because it seemed like a cute little film, and it was. It&apos;s not flawed or that amazing, but it&apos;s super enjoyable and funny, and it has a super hilarious actress in the lead role. I loved Noël Wells in Master of None&apos;s first season and I had no idea she was such a talented comedic actress. She&apos;s aces here and is definitely the best reason to watch the film. She&apos;s a huge talent to watch out for, not just in acting but in writing and directing.",
