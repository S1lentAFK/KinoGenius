    "reviewBody": "I saw lots of reviews for this movie, I guess most of those people are real Power Rangers fans. And i still can&apos;t realize: WHAT THE **** DID YOU EXPECT?!\n\nThis is a REBOOT. A completely new story, just like director said. This is the first movie in a new superhero franchise, and it needs to have a focus on the story and its characters, not on battles and morphing sequences. It&apos;s made for everybody except kids, because it&apos;s dark and much more serious than the TV show which was made mostly for kids. We have five teenagers and each of them has his own issues he needs to solve himself in order to become a hero (Power Ranger) and save the world. Every next situation in the movie makes our heroes closer to each other and stronger as a team.\n\nI personally enjoyed watching this movie because it is dark, amazing, emotional, funny(of course not that much like the TV show), and has AWESOME introduction to the whole story and its main characters. I can only imagine what&apos;s planned for the sequel. CAN&apos;T WAIT FOR THAT!!! #GO #GO #POWER #RANGERS",
