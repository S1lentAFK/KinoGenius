    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just been to see The Bye Bye Man and i can honestly say it isn&apos;t that bad. OK so it isn&apos;t going to win any awards and its unlikely to be a horror classic. But if you go in expecting little then its a pretty decent horror film. Its pitched somewhere between Sinister and it follows. \n\nPros\n\nIts quite easy to watch. Fairly decent story\n\nCons The acting is below average. The story had potential to be really good but seemed to lack in a proper back story and the main characters were lacking any real personality.\n\nOverall If you are looking for an amazing horror film then this probably isn&apos;t for you. If you want something fairly enjoyable for 90 minutes i can think of worse films to watch.",
