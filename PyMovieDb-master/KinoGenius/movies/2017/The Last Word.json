    "reviewBody": "This is a predictable movie - will not give anything away as you will see it for yourself. Shirley Maclaine is fun to watch and believable -she is a lady used to having her way and all of a sudden she is having questions about how she will be remembered. The main characters beside her, are the obit writer and the young person she is going to help and turn their life around. This is a film that is easy to watch, predictable and believable. Just not a great one but a good way to spend the afternoon.",
