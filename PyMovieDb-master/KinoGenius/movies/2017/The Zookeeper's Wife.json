    "reviewBody": "A film with promising actors and based upon an incredible true story, however didn&apos;t fill up to its high expectations, sadly. \n\nSomething that always troubles me, is feeling the need to speak English with an accent to show that they&apos;re actually speaking another language. It&apos;s in fact ridiculous, knowing that Johan Heldenbergh is pure Belgian (and actually speaks English with a Flemish/Ghent accent) and Jessica Chastain is pure American (her English/polish accent is just ridiculous). Either you just speak plain English or you make the movie with Polish actors. Besides that, Johan Heldenbergh, the zookeeper, (world-renown in Belgium but his first introduction in a bigger US production), was impeccable & perfectly casted.\n\nThe film didn&apos;t blow me away and was predictable from beginning till the end. Fairly enjoyable for a regular weeknight if you have nothing to do, but will most certainly be forgotten the next day - not anywhere near classic holocaust movies like Schindler&apos;s list or The Pianist. Too bad, cause everything was there (especially book & script) to make a much stronger impact.",
