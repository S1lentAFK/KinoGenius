    "reviewBody": "As a trans guy, I was trying really hard to relate to this character. Like really really hard since there are hardly any movies about the ftm experience. The actress really tried, but they just didn't seem to get it a lot of the time. Like when he said he wanted to be an astronaut instead of a princess or something. Those are gender roles, just because your child doesn't want to wear a dress doesn't mean they're trans. I also felt we didn't get to know much about Ray as a person. In the first part of the movie there were scenes at school and of him hanging out with friends, but it wasn't much. I wish we could have seen more of what his life was actually like instead of all the dad drama.\\n\\nAt least they fixed the ace bandages thing, thank god. I was already yelling at the screen but he got an actual binder. How he only just got that after having been out for years and how none of the therapists they talked to ever asked about it is another question.\\n\\nLike everyone has already pointed out there was too much focus on the mom. I really liked her at first, but then she kept being so selfish and honestly immature at times.\\n\\nI really wish they would have tried harder. I'm sure there are trans actors who would love to have played this role, who actually know what it's like.\\n\\nThis movie is not terrible. It's not unwatchable. But it's also not the amazing trans movie I've been looking for.",
