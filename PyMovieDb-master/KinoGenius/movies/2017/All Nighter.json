    "reviewBody": "This film was something unexpected. I am a fan of almost all the actors in the film but I loved the chemistry between Hirsch and Simmons. I thought the film was well paced and well acted and It's one film I can watch again (as I have). The direction was great and I love the fact the a young man who is heartbroken is able to live through the past of his love even though broken but he finds himself and he gets to know his ex better than he knew her when they were dating. I loved the film, I thought it was awesome.",
