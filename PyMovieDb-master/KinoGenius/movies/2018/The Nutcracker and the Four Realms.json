    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed it. It is a different take from the original piece of story, but that&apos;s how it&apos;s always supposed to go in Disney. Make it different and to revel who is the villain in the end. That&apos;s why it adds a twist within half way within the movie, cause that&apos;s what&apos;s make it enjoyable and I do love the twist in story that Clara is the main character that she understands what she most do is right.",
