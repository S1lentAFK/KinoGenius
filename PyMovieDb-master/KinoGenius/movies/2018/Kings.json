I thought that it would have been a great story but it just rambles on about nothing with a few original news items thrown in just to remind what is happening. I would give this a start rating of 2 and would be one of the mob=vies to avoid this year. \n\nI have never written a bad review before but just felt compelled to pen this one.",
