    "reviewBody": "I was a little nervous when I read that Jonah Hill was writing and directing a skateboarder drama. Being a skateboarder myself all my life, I really focused on how this movie was. Was it gonna be a wacky comedy or something serious? I walked out of the movie theatre with a massive smile on my face! This movie had the perfect tone to it. You really do feel for the characters and you really feel for Stevie. Growing up a skater, I really related to Stevie in the movie. while it focuses on a little kid becoming a skateboarder, it also deals with a lot of real life problems. Future, health, how hard some people&apos;s lives are. And this movie portrayed that beautifully! Hat tipped to Jonah hill! This is a must see not just for skateboarders for for everybody!",
