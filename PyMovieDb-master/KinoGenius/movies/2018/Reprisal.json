    "reviewBody": "Normally i avoid the current Bruce Willis films. Of lately Willis is jus doing horrible cameo appearances in horrible films n his photos r all over the dvd covers including his name n glimpes of him in the trailers. Coming to the film, the synopsis, the cast n trailer was good but the film was terrible. The villain Johnathon Schaech is shown attending to his old dad who&apos;s a decorated veteran, Schaech&apos;s repeated dialogue regarding an eye for an eye n his facial expressions conveyed that our villain might be doing the heist for some vengeance but alas the heist, the action and the end was meh. Also when Frank Grillo discusses with Willis about the robber, Willis&apos; face and body language looked as if Willis knows about the heist n the robber...... Wait, i dont want anybody else to waste their time in seein this awful film.",
