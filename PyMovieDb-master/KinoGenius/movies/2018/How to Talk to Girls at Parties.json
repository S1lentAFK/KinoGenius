    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s pretentious and cheesy, unique and amazing. The only promise I can make is that you have never seen anything like it. That in itself should be enough to make any movie or art lover feel like this movie was money and time well spent. Of course there are flaws, but it&apos;s punk, that&apos;s what gives it character. If you spend all your money on Hollywood reboots, stay far, far away... \n\nYou can enjoy the humor in this movie on the surface level or try to dig deeper into the many metaphors. I just went along for the ride and had a great time.",
