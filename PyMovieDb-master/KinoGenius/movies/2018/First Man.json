    "reviewBody": "This movie is incredible! Brilliant Acting, intense rocket flights and a unbelievably beautiful Soundtrack. A glimpse into the life of Neil Armstrong. No hero. Never was, never will be. Just a civilian with willpower and a goal. Nothing more to say. For me its a masterpiece and I can not understand the bad review.",
