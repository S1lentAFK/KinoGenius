    "reviewBody": "After all the recent Oscar winners I have been watching, Blockers was a welcome break. I had expected it to be really cheesy and a bit vulgar (and it was!) but it had some surprises and made me laugh! I had a really good time.\n\nThe parents were a hoot, and in character, John Cena and Leslie Mann were both really funny. I think the dialogue between girls could have been a bit more realistic. It felt contrived. Like guys writing for girls and how they think...since the script was written by 2 guys, that makes sense. \n\nA fun movie to watch, even though a bit unrealistic!",
