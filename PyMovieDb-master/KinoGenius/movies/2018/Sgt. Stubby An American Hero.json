    "reviewBody": "You don&apos;t very often see kids movie which are based on true stories or war. But that&apos;s what this film is about. And surprisingly, it works. \n\nThe strengths are the score, the story and the fact that it doesn&apos;t have one of the likely endings one might predict. I suspect the outcome is largely due to this being based on a true story. I&apos;m unaware how accurate this portrayal is to the real story, but it seemed like a respectable adaptation to me. The way they managed to show the awful reality of The Great War, while keeping it G rated is really a difficult triumph. It&apos;s important for kids to have movies that highlight errors in war, as opposed to just the victories and heroism. This film highlights both. \n\nThe weaknesses: the voice acting doesn&apos;t stand out as great. The dialogue isn&apos;t a strength. But they get a longer leash (no pun intended) because it&apos;s a kids movie. The animation is great in the 2D segments, and much of the 3D animation is fine. However there are clips where I can tell they didn&apos;t have the funds to make the animation as good as they&apos;d like it to be. The clips of the soldiers marching seem noticeably too synchronized and took me out of the story.\n\nOverall, I recommend this film to anyone. It&apos;s not a film expect to win Oscars or nominations. But, It&apos;s a distinctive likable real-story dog movie. And the film is especially good if you want a mostly uplifting real story for kids about a subject they likely know little about: World War 1. \n\nI&apos;m probably in the minority, but I find the history of World War 1 to be just interesting and important as World War 2. It seems the average person knows 10 times more about World War 2 than World War 1 and there&apos;s about 10 World War 2 movies for each World War 1 movie. World War 1 highlights how futile and unnecessarily evil war can be even for the victors. World War 2 on the other-hand, often enables the attitude of supporting war, because a lot of the losses to world war 2 seem worth it or necessary because of what was gained and what was at stake. A lot of wars are more like WW1 than WW2, and this is something we should all understand.",
