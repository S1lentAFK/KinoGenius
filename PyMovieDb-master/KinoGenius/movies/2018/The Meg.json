    "reviewBody": "Look, this movie wasn&apos;t bad... but it wasn&apos;t great either... Everything that comes with a shark movie was here. A cheesy storyline that bounced around a lot, and some great action sequences wth the shark. Jason Statham was the same as he usually is, stone faced and serious. Rainn Wilson did a great job with his part. But other than that, nothing really sticks out.",
