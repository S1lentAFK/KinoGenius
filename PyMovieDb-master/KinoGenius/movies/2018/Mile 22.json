    "reviewBody": "Trailer looked great, but the actual movie is just an awkward disappointment. This was weird, coming from director Peter Berg but I don&apos;t completely blame him. The writing is just awkward. Mark Wahlberg plays a super dedicated, grossly over-the-top special ops type guy who is just constantly going on rants to give intensity to the movie but it just comes off as weird, unnecessary, and confusing. Lauren Cohan is the most frustrated divorced mother ever. Finally, they cast Ronda Roussey only to give her ZERO fight scenes and barely any lines....great.\n\nThe star of the movie is the Iko Uwais character, with amazing fight scenes with perhaps too many fast changing angles so you cannot exactly follow what&apos;s happening. Action scenes were almost decent but the overall plot was so foolish it turned me off.",
