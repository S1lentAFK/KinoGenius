    "reviewBody": "Zoey Duetch is delightful I really like her energy! I don&apos;t understand the hate Flower got, the humor is great and story is solid. Kinda weird in some aspects like how the main character is obsessed with innuendo/crude things and how the plot is about catching predators. The music is magnificent, quite ambient with peculiar vibes!",
