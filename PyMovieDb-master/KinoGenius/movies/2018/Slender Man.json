    "reviewBody": "This movie was horrible . Longest hr & half of my life. It kept dragging and relied on not so scary jump scares. I was impressed with how much the trailer made the movie look scary and good but of course it was the wonders of cutting room floor editing. Plus most scenes in the trailer aren&apos;t in the movie!!!!",
