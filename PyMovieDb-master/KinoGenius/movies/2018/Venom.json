    "reviewBody": "Venom is a nice enjoyable superhero film which I was quite interested in. The film has a very Marvel story, it&apos;s not the first time I&apos;ve seen a story like this one but with just different characters and different settings. Though the story of not knowing whether Venom is good or evil is an interesting aspect not really seen before.\n\nBut I still found it quite enjoyable. There is no fantastic cinematography techniques or anything like that. But Venom played by Tom Hardy manages to deliver an amazing acting performance in comparison to other Marvel movies.\n\nI recommend Venom for superhero film fans to watch it&apos;s an interesting story with a little bit of a twist.",
