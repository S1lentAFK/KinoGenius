    "reviewBody": "They did a great job at building up the suspense in this movie! I&apos;m glad they recorded it with English voice overs. Even if some of the lines seem like they were meant for the younger crowd I think it&apos;s a must-see. I don&apos;t mind the voice overs when the story is this good. It gives me hope that I can find other quality foreign movies that are re-recorded in English.",
