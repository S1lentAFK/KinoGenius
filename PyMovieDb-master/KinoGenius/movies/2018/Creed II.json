    "reviewBody": "Creed II delivers the punch but doesn&apos;t quite land the knockout. While the familiar formula still works as inspiring as ever, it is mainly good ol&apos; Rock that steals the protagonist&apos;s spotlight. Without Sly&apos;s solid rock performance this movie would have been just another fight movie. And although the Creed saga reaches new hights in storytelling, we must admit that Adonis just isn&apos;t as charismatic as Rocky or as his dad, Apollo. This time he can&apos;t even step out of his opponent&apos;s shadow, who has a far more compelling story to tell than the one Adonis brings. So, this might not be the fight of the century but there is certainly some rumbling in the jungle. Hopefully we haven&apos;t seen the last of Rocky Balboa, cause he still knows how to bring magic to the big screen.",
