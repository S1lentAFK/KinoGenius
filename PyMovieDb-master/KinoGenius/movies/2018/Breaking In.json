    "reviewBody": "Home invasions are nothing new. This sets our protagonist outside the house though, which is not common. The movie itself tries to keep it as real as possible, but sometimes seems uneven when it comes to character behaviour. Then again if they behave just like a one way street it seems to easy to paper thin. So while this overall may seem flawed (I&apos;d argue it is), it still has some nice moments to it.\n\nSuspend your disbelief and let yourself emerge and just feel what the characters go through. The good ones that is. If you do that, you can be entertained to a degree. So while uncommon on one side, not really anything new overall.",
