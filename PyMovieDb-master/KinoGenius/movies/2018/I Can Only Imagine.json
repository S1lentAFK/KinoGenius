    "reviewBody": "As a Christian, I am often conflicted with the movies our &apos;community&apos; produces. Too often a beautiful story can be marred by a lack of quality writing, acting, and production.\n\nSo I admit to feeling tense as I sat in the theater this morning watching I Can Only Imagine, with an expectation that some cringe-worthy line or delivery would happen at any moment. Happily, this story-in-film hits the trifecta: quality writing, quality acting, and quality production.\n\nIt&apos;s not perfect. What film is?! But in a world where abuse happens all too often, here is a story of redemption, reconciliation, and hope, and it will impact anyone who sees it in a positive way. The worst of the abuse is spoke of, not acted out, making this a safe and inspiring movie choice for almost all ages. The faith of the main character is also portrayed in a subdued way--not with Bible-thumping or speeches.\n\nSee it, regardless of your belief system. And bring Kleenex.",
