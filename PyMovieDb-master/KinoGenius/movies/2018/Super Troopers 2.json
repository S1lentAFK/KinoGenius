    "reviewBody": "Like others have said, the plot is awful and basically a rehashing of the original just with Canadians. However, the boys made me laugh so much that I really didn&apos;t care. I don&apos;t see movies in theater too often but I knew it was important to support these guys so that they could keep giving us great content like this and honestly, I&apos;m really glad I did. Hearing the whole theater laugh in unison so loudly and so often reminded me of what it&apos;s like to have a great time at the movies. If you&apos;re a fan of the first or just a fan of good raunchy humor, I highly recommend seeing Super Troopers 2",
