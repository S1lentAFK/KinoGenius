    "reviewBody": "If there&apos;s anyone in Hollywood that I would believe is actually a real life bada**, it&apos;s probably Denzel Washington. The first Equalizer was a surprisingly brutal and visceral action film that gave Liam Neeson movies a run for its money. While the sequel is full of just as many, if not more, incredible kill sequences by Denzel&apos;s character, I think there&apos;s a lack of connection I felt this time around. I wasn&apos;t nearly as connected to the story, and perhaps that&apos;s because the revenge didn&apos;t feel as sweet this time around. The ending of the film is a great sequence on its own and there are certain scenes I will certainly revisit, but I&apos;m not sure the film as a whole works quite as well.\n\n6.6/10",
