    "reviewBody": "(No spoilers -- this is intended to be vague because you really want to watch this one and get your perspective from it)\n\nI know the critics seem to be heavy on this one and many who have reviewed this movie either love it or somewhat don&apos;t know what to say. Let me help those who would rather watch movies with not so easy plots and scene sequences to guide you through the story/narrative. \n\nI will start by saying this movie hits well on mystery and/or unanswered questions. If you want the normal thrills that easily hand you the plot from start to finish you will probably not take so well to this one. \n\nI love the beautiful scenes of somber to horrific type footage. The story and plot was woven into those scenes very methodically so to not give you a linear way of grasping the whole of the movie. They should make more like this. The directors and actors were on point. Casting could NOT have been better....no big time stars to overshadow the story -- just some good old original creativity. Watch this movie with your mind on...not off.",
