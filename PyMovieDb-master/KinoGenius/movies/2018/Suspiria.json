    "reviewBody": "A lot of bad reviews on here probably from those expecting a copy of the original. I personally didn&apos;t want a copy (what&apos;s the point in that?), the original had a chilling score and beautiful visuals but wasn&apos;t all that scary. They say this movie is an art scene but in my opinion, the original focuses more on art as it does actual horror. This Suspiria delves more into the coven of witches and the substance you would want from a so called horror movie. I am a massive horror fan but I pick what I watch wisely as the horror genre as a whole is only 25% good. If you want substance then watch this film, if you want cheap jump scares, lack of story and crappy Hollywood types then look elsewhere.",
