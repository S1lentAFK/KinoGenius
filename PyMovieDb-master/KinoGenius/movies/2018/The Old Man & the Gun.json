    "reviewBody": "&apos;The Old Man & The Gun&apos; is Robert Redford&apos;s final acting role. It&apos;s not quite a fitting finale - he&apos;s great as Forrest Tucker, the aging bank robber, but the overall film fall&apos;s a little flat. Based on a true story, most of his exciting adventures and prison breaks are glossed over, in favour of him finding late-life love with (Spacek). He can&apos;t curb his compulsion to rob banks however, and it assisted by Teddy (Glover) & Waller (Waits), but underutilised.\n\nDetective Hunt (Affleck) is the Texas cop out to catch him - we also spend unnecessary amounts of time with his home-life. The chemistry between Redford and Spacek is good, and he&apos;s still as charming as ever. Affleck plays an exhausted cop as almost too dreary. Instead of seeing any heist planning or prison breaks (besides a montage), we instead get Redford and Spacek talking in a diner, walking, or making tea.\n\nThankfully, it&apos;s a quick 90min film, but the pacing and action could&apos;ve been much better. Tehre&apos;s some chuckles, but nothing hilarious. You&apos;re better off re-watching &apos;The Sting&apos;!",
