    "reviewBody": "This prehistoric European film about a young man who is presumed lost while his tribe is on a hunt. Kodi Smit-McPhee stars as the young man in a primitive world who makes his way back to his family with the aid of a new best friend he&apos;s made, a wild dog whom he patched up and the two develop a co-dependency on each other in this first boy and a dog story.\n\nBeautifully photographed in some stark vistas in British Columbia, the most amazing thing about this film that even with some cheating subtitles young Smit-McPhee with primeval grunts and gibberish to pass for caveman language conveys all the emotion of pages of dialog.\n\nThis one is a winner, highly recommended.",
