    "reviewBody": "Just saw this movie with my 18 year old son. We both laughed out loud. It is a very verbose script with lots of sardonic humor and dialogue. But we really liked it. Always a fan of Rider and Reeves. They are just my generation and I have a certain affection for their movies. What was surprising is that my teenage son liked it so much. I was a little skeptical taking him to see it because I knew it had mixed reviews. In the end he said he found it entertaining. The whole movie is all about the two charters meeting each other and their interpretation of the wedding. There is no other context or character interaction, but it works. It&apos;s an amusing delightful weird unorthodox relationship movie.",
