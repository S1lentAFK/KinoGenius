    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ll start with my usual writer/director moan although this isn&apos;t as bad as most, and Vaughn Stein almost pulls it off.\n\nIt&apos;s visually stunning, has some superb actors - Margot Robbie in particular - but the convoluted story-telling style and, indeed, the plot, make it less than it should have been. You&apos;ll have to keep your eyes and ears open and resist the temptation to walk out or switch off 20-30 mins into the movie. The stopy lines do come together, if slightly haphazardly.\n\nThere are some nice twists. One or two you&apos;ll probably have an inkling of. One you won&apos;t as there&apos;s no foreshadowing at all, and although it ties everything (mostly) together, you may well feel cheated as the writer(*/director) swaggers about thinking what a clever writer I am!\n\nStill, immerse yourself in a comic/noir-ish nightmare and see what you think.",
