    "reviewBody": "I understand why a lot of critics don&apos;t like this film, but at the same time I feel like they&apos;re making up their minds about what they think the movie is - or should - be about. They (who disagree with the film) will say that it diminishes the horrors that the black community faced in America during the 50&apos;s - and because of that they think it&apos;s a bad film. But I thought it was a good film; in my opinion it&apos;s not a movie about Shirley and his struggles facing ruthless racism - it&apos;s about Tony Lip&apos;s psychologically reforming journey changing his mind about black people through the witnessing of Shirley&apos;s experiences. And it&apos;s that central story line the critics are disagreeing with and eschews the whole film on the premiss that it should&apos;ve been about something else (Shirley journey - not Tony&apos;s).\n\nThere are thousands - if not millions - of films about racism towards black people and their culture, and Green Book had a different perspective than the rest of them - by not focusing on the racism but on how the racism changed a man who wasn&apos;t a target of it. But that&apos;s obviously a big no-no according to these critics.\n\nTo me Green Book is about a white man thoroughly changing his whole mindset about something that he&apos;d been conditioned to abide to his whole life.",
