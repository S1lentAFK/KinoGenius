    "reviewBody": "Well I like the idea of spooky stuff going on in an old boarding school. I just didn&apos;t think this movie did it very memorably. Uma being miscast was distracting, although I thought Anna was likeable. The ending did have some level of satisfaction, but nothing that will stay with you. Just a cheaply made disposable horror that no one will find scary.",
