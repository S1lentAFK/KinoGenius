    "reviewBody": "What a great actioner, if you loved his other movie LONDON HAS FALLEN which i did then you won&apos;t be disappointed with this one.\n\nIf you look forward to a brutal revenge flicks like DEATH WISH or TAKEN then this is right up your street. A good pace and impressive action choreography.\n\nForget the overly negative criticism from the parasite critics that have an agenda with this film, its totally unfair what they are saying about this film, just remember that they did exactly the same with TAKEN and look how that turned out. The public are voicing their approval of this one aswel.",
