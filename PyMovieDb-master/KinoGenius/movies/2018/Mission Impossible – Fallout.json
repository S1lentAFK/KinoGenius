    "reviewBody": "I regretted missing the theatrical experience of Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) having heard the resounding acclaim surrounding it. It stood atop my watchlist, and my expectations soared accordingly. My recent binge of the MI series (considering I didn&apos;t want to miss 7A: The Dead Reckoning in theatres), with Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation impressing me to a great extent, amplified my expectations for Fallout, the part 6.\n\nFallout commenced admirably, yet the pacing felt sluggish compared to its predecessors. While the motorcycle stunts and visuals were impressive, I felt, they couldn&apos;t match the magnificence of Ghost Protocol. Despite the suspense building in the second half, it fell short of entirely meeting my heightened expectations.\n\nEthan Hunt, as always, astounded with his heroic persona, though Benji&apos;s charm appeared somewhat lackluster in comparison to the previous installments. The absence of Jeremy Renner was felt keenly.\n\nNonetheless, the climax redeemed the film, elevating it to exceptional heights, particularly with the awe-inspiring stunts and visuals in the final 15 minutes, including the remarkable heist in France.\n\nMission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) delivers moments of brilliance, but I felt it leaves some unfulfilled promises, making it a mixed bag of excitement and suspense.\n\nPS: I have written the review for all the M:I movies. Thank you!",
