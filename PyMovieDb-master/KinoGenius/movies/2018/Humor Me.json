    "reviewBody": "This was an amusing little story about family, complacency, dealing with loss (or not), moving on and redemption, couched in jokes and likable characters. It wasn&apos;t a must see film, but it wasn&apos;t bad either. I didn&apos;t feel like I wasted my time like with some movies, but I think the cast is what made it worth seeing. \n\nJermaine clement is great as always, and it was interesting to see him with an American accent. Elliot Gould did a fine job as the dad who&apos;s constantly telling corny jokes, and it was also nice to see Annie Potts in the first thing I&apos;ve seen her in since Ghostbusters. All in all, it was a decent film, with humour and some heart.",
