    "reviewBody": "I went and saw this movie when it came out, and really enjoyed myself. I had previously only seen the first Insidious movie, but I had zero confusion as to what was happening. The character development was nothing special, but I thought that the character Elise was very well done, and the actress did an incredible job. I enjoyed the scares, they were still a little cheesy the way Insidious was, but it scared me enough!\n\nGreat ending to a fun series.",
