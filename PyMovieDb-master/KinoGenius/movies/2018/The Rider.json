    "reviewBody": "I love big budget blockbusters like Black Panther and Infinity Wars but there is a special place in my heart for the little guy with the little film with a little budget that can still bring the story home. I do not usually like sad stories. I firmly believe that movies should first entertain and then teach a lesson just like the best children&apos;s story. This is sometimes painful to watch but you have to root for Brady Blackburn. The shots of the Badlands are spectacular, the emotion heartfelt and the filmmaker&apos;s vision realized.",
