    "reviewBody": "I like Mila Kunis, and find her performances generally entertaining. This film was no exception. There was plenty of over-the-top action, but I found it lacking in the comedy department (a few chuckles, but nothing more). My main criticism is that it dragged on too long, and I finally turned it off with about 20 minutes left, not caring how everything finally resolved. It needed to be funnier for me to recommend it, but as it stands, if someone asked me if it was worth the time, I&apos;d tell them &apos;no.&apos;",
