    "reviewBody": "Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is troubled living in New York City caring for his elderly mother and asphyxiating himself for comfort from a troubling past. He is hired to recover State Senator Albert Votto&apos;s runaway young daughter Nina from an underaged girls brothel. He buys a hammer and smashes his way through his crusade. He saves Nina but are confronted by murderous corrupt cops. It&apos;s the tip of a dangerous conspiracy leading all the way to the governor&apos;s mansion.\n\nThe first thirty minutes is a bit rough. It&apos;s an artsy meandering slow disjointed slice of life into Joe. I get it but it could be clearer. It does give a feel for the guy. It would be great to have a more complete flashback to his military or policing days instead of short flashes of everything. Once he gets hammering, the movie goes like a freight train with Joaquin driving hard. He delivers a great performance as usual. There is a shock ending which I don&apos;t like. Indies like to punctuate the end of their movies with a gunshot. It&apos;s a bit cheap and feels amateurish. Overall, there are some great work with a few flaws.",
