    "reviewBody": "If you are willing to stoop to mere name recognition to get views you&apos;ve already lost my respect. A black smudge on everyone involved. Am I too harsh? No. It&apos;s not a bad story and not badly executed, but when some nameless groom burns down the stable it shows disrespect to the audience on another level. This story is diametrically opposite to the story of Black Beauty.\n\nDon&apos;t get me wrong, I love re-envisioned classics but it must be analogous to the original.",
