    "reviewBody": "Sophia Loren at 86 has returned to us along with her Co-Star Ibrahima Gueye in her son&apos;s film. Though the film is a re-make and the story rather predictable, what is not is the performance of these two actors. The cast is good, but the leads are on a different level. And their final scenes together are deeply moving. I have never seen Ms Loren more touching and filled with grace, nor a 12-year-old boy more beautiful and talented. Sophia has given us a gift in both the film and this young actor whose future is so brilliant.",
