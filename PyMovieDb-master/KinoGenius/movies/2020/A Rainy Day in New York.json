    "reviewBody": "People will tell you this isn&apos;t Woody&apos;s best film but it&apos;s still more enjoyable, intelligent and amusing than almost all films being made each year. In the same way a lesser-known Klimt painting is still a multi-million dollar masterpiece any Woody Allen film is still a class act.",
