    "reviewBody": "The Kid Detective, not really a title that is very appealing, but the truth is that this movie is certainly entertaining. The humor is most of the time subtle. To me the mystery level is what makes this movie stand out. I don&apos;t know if the humor was really necessary to make this a good movie. But it&apos;s there, subtle and dark at times, it made me giggle a couple times, not rolling over from laughing but good enough to make me grin. The plot is well written, definitely the best thing about The Kid Detective. Nice twists, and an ending that will surprise more than one. The acting was good and that from the whole cast. Better than I expected to be honest.",
