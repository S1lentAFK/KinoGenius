    "reviewBody": "I am glad that I was able to learn about the story of Bernard Garrett and Joe Morris. This movie was enjoyable to watch and Samuel Jackson and Anthony Mackie are excellent together in this film. Of course it is upsetting to watch the racism of that period continually roadblock and take from Garrett and Morris but, it was much more enjoyable watching their accomplishments. History its what it is...it can&apos;t be erased.",
