    "reviewBody": "Initially I thought this film would be just cute characters singing pop songs all the time. In fact there is a plot which touches heartstrings too. The colour scheme is kaleidoscopic, and the music is infectiously catchy. It is one big party, but it also has a message for adults to think about. I enjoyed this way more than I thought I would.",
