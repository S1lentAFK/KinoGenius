    "reviewBody": "Everything in this movie has been done umpteenth no of times but the fact that inspite of this the movie managed to create ample amount of suspense n tension throughout.\n\nThe guy who played the stalker indeed looked n behaved very creepy.\n\nThe lead actress gave a decent performance.\n\nThis movie reminded me of Hush (2016) n other low budget 90s thrillers.\n\nGood to see Anthony Heald aft a long time.",
