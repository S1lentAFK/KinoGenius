    "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t think of a single animated feature film done by Disney that I don&apos;t like. For some reason they never bore me and they never feel the same. The classics like &apos;Snow White&apos; and &apos;Cinderella&apos; are great but I think I like the newer ones (&apos;The Little Mermaid&apos;, &apos;Beauty and the Beast&apos;, &apos;The Lion King&apos;) even more. &apos;Mulan&apos; definitely belongs to the best ones.\n\nMulan is a girl who doesn&apos;t do much right. For the honor of her family she joins the army instead of her father. She takes his gear and runs off. She pretends to be a man and does the training to go to war against the Huns who invaded China.\n\nWith some nice new songs, great music by Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful animations this is a real Disney. A little dragon called Mushu is helping her on the way. He is send by the ancestors. The voice of Mushu is from Eddie Murphy and he does a very great job. With a quick and good story and a lot of funny moments this is a great movie.",
