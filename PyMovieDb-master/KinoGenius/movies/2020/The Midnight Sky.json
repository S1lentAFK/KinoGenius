    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s hard to know what this movie is about or what it tried to accomplish. Most of the time you just don&apos;t have any idea of what is going on or where the story is going.\n\nAfter so many great movies like Interestellar, The Martian and others, it&apos;s incredible to understand why movie studios won&apos;t hire a physicist to advise them on the science portion of the movie. Very disappointing.",
