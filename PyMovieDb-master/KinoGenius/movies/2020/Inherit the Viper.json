    "reviewBody": "I did and this is no where near true. Some parts, the devastating losses and deaths but idk meeting a kid in a field for two bottles of pills and get handed a supposed duffel bag full of cash. First of all I don&apos;t care if those pill bottles had 100 oxy 80&apos;s each, that would still only be able 15 thousand dollars. So enough to fill a duffel bag? Nah I don&apos;t think so. The kid that got injected when he was murdered by Josie? It takes a lot longer for someone to shoot a drug and feel the effects. It&apos;s not boom, needle in arm in 1 second.\n\nI&apos;m still waiting for a good opioid epidemic movie that just captures the true story of it. Something about Florida&apos;s oxycontin express, the pill mills in browsed county, deaths, arrests, shady doctors. Not just the addicts of it. We need a good movie to show the full story.\n\nThis was a good try but yeah it&apos;s obvious the director/writer whoever didn&apos;t really understand this world.",
