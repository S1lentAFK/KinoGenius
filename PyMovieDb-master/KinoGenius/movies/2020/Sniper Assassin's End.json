    "reviewBody": "Story is well but presentation is average though it would have many chances to make interesting movie. However it not bad too, once time watchable. Some sequences like fight Between Beckett and Lady Death and investigation by Mr. Zero are interesting. Michael Jonson impressed us with his height and deadly grip (Remember me &apos;Billa&apos; (Manik Irani) in Bollywood) . Last snipping scene by father of Beckett is with full of thrill. Watch at once with not much expectations then you will enjoy this thrilling ride of spy drama.",
