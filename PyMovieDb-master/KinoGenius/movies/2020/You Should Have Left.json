    "reviewBody": "Watch this film, knowing what you get yourself into watching and this thought alone will make you enjoy it. Kevin Bacon is always fun to see acting and he does a good job here, carrying most of this film literally on his shoulders. The cinematography is eye-pleasing and the music and atmosphere immersive. Together with a sufficient run time which does not get long and tiring, these elements make it a good combo for a film to watch if you have no better alternative. The main problem in this film is the dialogue and generally the script. Its difficult to say this is a great psychological thriller while its dialogue... kinda sucks. Luckily there is not that much dialogue in the second half of the film, so you can enjoy a bit the experience of a thriller which is not meant to jump scare you, but to give you an eerie feeling overall. 6/10",
