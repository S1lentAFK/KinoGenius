    "reviewBody": "This is definitely worth a watch. I&apos;m a very picky viewer and if a film doesn&apos;t grab me in the first 10 minutes then I&apos;ll quickly turn it off. I&apos;m happy to report this kept be interested for the full (nearly) 90 minute run time, which is the perfect length for a picture like this IMHO.\n\nJaime Lannister once again did not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed Shot Caller so I figured I&apos;d give this a try as well and I&apos;m glad I did. A couple decent plot twists along with good performances from all actors and a decent script held this picture together quite well.\n\nIts far from Oscar worthy, but its also slightly above straight DVD, $1 store trash bin. Just a decent little thriller that should hold your attention for 90+ minutes. I recommend it.",
