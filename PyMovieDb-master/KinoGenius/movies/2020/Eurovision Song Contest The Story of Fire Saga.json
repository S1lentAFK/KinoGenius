    "reviewBody": "This is worth watching just for Dan Stevens&apos;s portrayal of the Russian entrant, Alexander - brilliant acting and worthy of an award. Iceland&apos;s Final song is fantastic and I&apos;ve already saved it in my Spotify playlist - another reason to watch the movie. One of the best lines in the movie for me was about elves taking things too far... had me & my friend in stitches.",
