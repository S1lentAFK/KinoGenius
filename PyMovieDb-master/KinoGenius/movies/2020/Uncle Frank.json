    "reviewBody": "This is a film of love, partners, family and mostly self. A beautifully shot, thoughtful take on the challenges of traditional 70&apos;s thinking and the challenges of a gay life within a family.\n\nA superbly acted film, tense and moving, warmed with love. It&apos;s not an easy watch, and shouldn&apos;t be. In saying that it has fun and warmth. Recommended.",
