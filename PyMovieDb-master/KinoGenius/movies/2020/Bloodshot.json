    "reviewBody": "I love Vin Diesel. But this movie is a Vin Diesel movie like any other. Lots and lots of action and a rather thin story behind it. The movie wasn&apos;t bad, but it was very predictable. The story had some good elements which could have made for a great movie. It just seems unfinished. I would not go and see it at the movies, its not worth the money.",
