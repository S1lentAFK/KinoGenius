    "reviewBody": "I did enjoy this movie although I&apos;m still not sure what it was about or what its point was.\n\nEvan Rachel Ward painted an interesting character and delivered one of the best sight gag I&apos;ve seen in a while. The one where they bending low under the fence so the land lord won&apos;t see them and she bends backwards. I don&apos;t know how she did it but it was pure 3 stooges comedy without the slapping. Loved it.\n\nAs mentioned by others the hand to mouth existence was a good and enlightening one. Each day required to get them to the next and so on.\n\nI didn&apos;t think I was going to like Gina Rodriguez&apos;s character but she totally won me over. She made sense and earned her place and her ray of sunshine delivery and burdened with beauty world weariness was interesting too.",
