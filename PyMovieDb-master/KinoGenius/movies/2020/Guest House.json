    "reviewBody": "I was excited to see Pauly Shore and don&apos;t regret paying to rent this because at least the money will go to the film crew who worked hard. That being said, this movie has nothing to offer and is empty and the lead actors playing the young couple are so utterly dull and unlikeable. But the worst offense of this film is that: IT IS NOT FUNNY. Not one second. Really bummed me out because I needed some funny.",
