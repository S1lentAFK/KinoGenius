    "reviewBody": "All My Life is a pretty positive heartwarming film with leads that are impossible not to love and a supporting cast who felt like a big family. The soundtrack is also a stand out. However, It sure guarantees you to shed a tear. I think the director is more than aware of how to operate his audience into psychological submission, but in a year like 2020, overt sugary cliches aren&apos;t necessarily a bad thing when the packaging is as appealing as this.I loved how the movie embraces the best moments of life rather than dwelling on the sad ones. It sure did made me smile. Also, hands down to one of the best film proposals.",
