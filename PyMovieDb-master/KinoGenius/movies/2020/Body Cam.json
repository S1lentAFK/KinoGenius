    "reviewBody": "I think this non pretentious B-horror movie is quite good. If you loved movies like Mothman prophecies and Black and Blue this one is for you. As a B-movie horror fan, I have to say this one has the usual flaws like the script and acting, but on the other hand the execution of the story is pretty well done and some murder scenes are A+. Also, FX&apos;s are pretty decent. So, overall good entertainment during the quarentine if you&apos;re looking for some decent horror cop thriller.",
