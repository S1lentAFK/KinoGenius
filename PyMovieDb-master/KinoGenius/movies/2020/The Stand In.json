    "reviewBody": "This was beyond bad from start to finish. Do yourself a favour and do not rent or watch this horror of a movie. Made it through only because we paid for it. It was an embarrassment for Drew Barrymore and we kept asking ourselves, why on earth did she do this movie. It&apos;s uncomfortable to watch and not at all funny.",
