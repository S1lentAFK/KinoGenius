    "reviewBody": "As it&apos;s dads 92nd birthday we went to see a movie I knew he&apos;d love, Call of the Wild. Based on the classic novel by Jack London the movie tells the story of Buck the dog and his adventures as a comfortable city dog to a working dog in The Yukon, this is squarely aimed at the family market, playing down the cruel treatment of sled dogs and the harsh life. The CGI animals were good but didn&apos;t take me out of myself. It&apos;s schmalzy and cheesy but good fun and I shed a few tears. 3.5 stars George: A very dramatic movie with fantastic scenery of The Yukon! The animal animation was fantastic and Harrison Ford played a good role as the curmudgeonly loner. I remember reading Jack London&apos;s novels and I enjoyed this adaptation very much. 4 stars PS Meredith cried several times.",
