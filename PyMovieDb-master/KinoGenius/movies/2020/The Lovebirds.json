    "reviewBody": "This film is very hit or miss. At times it can be really funny. For example one of the first scenes of the leads as a couple in their apartment is great. I think it really gets how couples are and how they argue about trivial things and they make it really funny.\n\nBut the film can get bogged down by the jokes that don&apos;t land and can kinda make you cringe slightly.\n\nIssa Rea is great and probably my favourite part of the movie. Most of her lines land and don&apos;t get me wrong Kumail is really good to but some of his line do fall flat.\n\nThe plot is also kinda predictable and basic but it doesn&apos;t make it any less enjoyable.\n\nI also noticed that Netflix basically did zero promotion for this movie which I found strange but Iv have kind of come to expect that from Netflix.\n\nSo it&apos;s an easy watch and you&apos;ll get a few laughs I&apos;d say give it a watch",
