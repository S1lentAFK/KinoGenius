I think the problem is the film can&apos;t decide if it&apos;s an awkward comedy or a sweet rom-com - it tries to be both, but doesn&apos;t quite manage either. It&apos;s still enjoyable, if just a little unsatisfying. Watch if you have a few hours to kill, aren&apos;t necessarily giving your full attention, but want something less twee than Hallmark.",
