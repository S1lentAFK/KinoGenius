    "reviewBody": "This movie is just weird. In order to enjoy it just don&apos;t take it seriously because it doesn&apos;t even take itself seriously. The story is ridiculous and cheesy but enjoyable because weirdly the ridiculousness of it is what makes it fun and entertaining. Emily Blunt is awesome and Jamie Dornan is very good. The cinematography is stunning with amazing sceneries of the Irish landscapes, it made me fall in love with the country. Wild Mountain Thyme is a cute funny stupid movie, if you&apos;re in the mood for such films then don&apos;t miss it out.",
