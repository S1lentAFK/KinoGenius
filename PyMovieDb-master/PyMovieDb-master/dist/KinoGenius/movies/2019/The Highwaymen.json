    "reviewBody": "Movie that takes place in the 30s it was truly well done and very well thought out. This movie created the mystery of bonnie and clyde and the drama and havoc the created throughout the south. The true story of these 2 retired rangers made this all the more appealing. Kevin costner was a magnificent choice for haymer! Harrelson was perfect as his partner. I really enjoyed the big names in this movie down to Kathy bates. Very happy with the detail this film portrayed.",
