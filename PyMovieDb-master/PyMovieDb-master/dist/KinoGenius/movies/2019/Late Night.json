    "reviewBody": "A feel-good movie with strong similarities with The Devil Wears Prada (2006) and Network (1976). Katherine Newbury (Emma Thompson) is the host of a famous talk show. She has nevertheless rested on her laurels and has badly reacted to the gravis illness of her husband who is obviously the unique pillar of her life, even if she did not realize it yet. Because the talk show is now a shadow of its former self, Katherine needs now new blood to invigorate the texts prepared by her team of dialog writers. Until the improbable arrival of Molly (Mindy Kaling).\n\nThe pace is dynamic with excellent verbal jousts and the characters are rather well-built. 6/7 of 10",
