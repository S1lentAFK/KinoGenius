    "reviewBody": "This movie definitely gives a positive message to the kids. Don&apos;t let your appearance/looks define who you are. Don&apos;t give up your dreams even though you are lack of something. Most important don&apos;t judge a book by its cover. This movie is not the best animation but for sure good message through out the movie.",
