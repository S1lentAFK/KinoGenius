    "reviewBody": "Miss Bala\n\nThanks to all of the vacant space in their heads, beauty pageant contestants make for the best border mules.\n\nRegrettably, the cartel in this action movie made the mistake of selecting a make-up artist instead.\n\nWhile visiting her pageant contestant friend down south, Gloria (Gina Rodriguez) witnesses a gang shooting. But when she goes to the authorities, they take her straight to the gang responsible. Now she must run guns and money across the US border or else they will kill her friend. Meanwhile, the DEA (Anthony Mackie) is also using Gloria to gather Intel on the gang.\n\nFeaturing some of the worst dialogue ever uttered, not to mention the most banal action even scenes recorded, this needlessly convoluted adaptation of the Mexican original is all over the place and nowhere all at once.\n\nBesides, the best way to smuggle across the US border is to label shipments: Border Wall Material.
