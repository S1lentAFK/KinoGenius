    "reviewBody": "So... It&apos;s a straight to Netflix movie. I was not expecting some Oscar nominated performances or plotlines. It&apos;s October and Halloween is around the corner and I just wanted to snuggle up and watch a decent thriller and I believe this movie accomplished what I was looking for. It was psychological, suspenseful and actually had very great acting by the main character played by Sam Worthington. The rest of the cast was quite forgetable but not terrible by any means.\n\nI don&apos;t want to spoil the plot but I will just say that the movie was a lot of fun and it did keep me guessing until the very end so that is definitely an added bonus.",
