    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this movie and there&apos;s nothing really wrong with it. It just isn&apos;t all that great. By the end of the movie I had a feeling who the killer was, which ended up being true. I was waiting for another twist but nope, that was it. I understand he&apos;s supposed to be the worlds greatest detective, but it just seemed too easy for him to put together.\n\nBesides that, some of the characters are forgettable. If you compare this to a movie like Clue, where every character was interesting and brought something to the table, this falls short. Craig and Norton are excellent. I don&apos;t know why people are riding Craig for his accent. I thought it was good.\n\nI didn&apos;t understand the whole mask pandemic thing. It&apos;s only in the beginning of the movie. I just kept thinking that it was stupid and probably won&apos;t age well. Didn&apos;t affect the plot at all so why put that in there?\n\nOverall it&apos;s a fun movie and worth watching but don&apos;t expect too much out of it. Had a cool vibe though and enough interesting twists to keep me entertained. Not every movie has to be a masterpiece.",
