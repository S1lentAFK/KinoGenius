    "reviewBody": "Being the country where the movie industry thrives the most, it&apos;s only natural that a lot of the scripts, are actually about that same country&apos;s history\n\nI&apos;ve seen a lot of american movies, based on true political events that have continuously shocked me to my core, on how powerful law enforcement and government institutions keep getting away with the most inhuman actions, and even worse, these actions being completely ignored or supported by the people\n\nI get it, the political climate in the US will make people dislike the movie if they tend to support a specific political color, given the interventionists, however as a non-american I appeal everyone to look away on political ideology and really absorb the message, as being ignorant is no longer an excuse. It&apos;s not about politics, race or whatever other topic that keeps dividing people, it&apos;s about the total lost of humanity\n\nAs a movie is well executed and conveys the event&apos;s story line in a concise and organized fashion. Adam Driver delivers, and the high score goes for the message and awareness!",
