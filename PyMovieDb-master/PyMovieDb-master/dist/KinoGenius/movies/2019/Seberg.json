    "reviewBody": "I hate that people can give film reviews or ratings on IMDB without having seen the film.\n\nFirstly, if you don&apos;t like an actor, just don&apos;t watch the film. Don&apos;t go onto a ratings site a skew the scores.\n\nSecondly, if you want to see a complete accurate portrayal of a biography watch the History channel.\n\nThis is based on the story of Jean Seberg and her persecution by the FBI. Is it groundbreaking? No. Is it a sanitised version of what is known? Yes.\n\nKristen Stewart more than held her own in this film. It didn&apos;t have a great script and the cinematography was clunky, and even though she had a pretty good supporting cast, they really didn&apos;t have much to play with. Its okay. But I wouldn&apos;t watch it again.",
