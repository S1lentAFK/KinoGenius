    "reviewBody": "Another Terrance Malick film but - thank God - it&apos;s not like his last ones. He is back. I was bored of the idea of another Anti-Nazi film but I&apos;m telling you it&apos;s not. This is a film about pride, bravery, principles, choice, humanity. As usual from Malick: great shots and cinematography, great monologues, such an incredible soundtrack that deserved an Oscar nomination (also the cinematography). But still the editing got me confused at some scenes, it was a weakness point. The cast are all good especially August Diehl & Valerie Pachner. No cliches, no heroes, just a simple man whose opinion won&apos;t affect the war and no one would listen to it, but he is still standing for his principles to make himself and his family proud of himself as a human. A Hidden Life of a hidden family. Some people could get bored quickly so it&apos;s simply not for them. They have a lot of films for their taste. It&apos;s ok everyone has a taste. Just enjoy and let people enjoy.",
