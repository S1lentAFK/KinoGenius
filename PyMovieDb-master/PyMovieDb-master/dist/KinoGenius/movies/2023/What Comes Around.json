    "reviewBody": "What Comes Around starts with Jerry Reed (I don&apos;t remember what Reed&apos;s and Hopkins&apos;s characters&apos; names were, and IMDb doesn&apos;t list them.) being maybe 17 or 18 years old or a little older in 1958 or so. He has a rockabilly band playing in a joint called The King of Clubs. Then a Colonel Tom Parker character takes him away from the home farm to make it big in the music business. Fast forward to the 1980s. Reed is in sort of the condition of Elvis before he died. Bo Hopkins, his brother, sets out to keep him from going down the drain. Arte Johnson is in this movie. Would you expect him in a country music movie? And a nice unmarried woman fan should help give old Jerry a new lease on life, shouldn&apos;t she? Reed owns a business venture with the Parker dude played by Barry Corbin. Reed wants to divide their interests. Parker doesn&apos;t. How does Jerry divide the business? Well, since this is a Jerry Reed movie, there&apos;s a good chance there&apos;s a diesel truck or bus in it somewhere. Well, I&apos;ll quit writing now. I&apos;ve got a craving for cornbread.",
