    "reviewBody": "This movie is about looking at your life. Enough is enough - More can kill you.\n\nPeople and Society expect you to be as much as possible. If you have ability then you have to use it to progress as far as you can. This movie says - just enjoy what you want to be. Less is More.\n\nThe two Mum&apos;s represent the pressures that Society put on you. The antique shop guys represent a world where you can enjoy who you are - but even that can be sad if you lose your soulmate - but even that can be pisitive if you reflect on the joy that it brought.\n\nThis movie is great - if you are willing to hear, rather than just listen.",
