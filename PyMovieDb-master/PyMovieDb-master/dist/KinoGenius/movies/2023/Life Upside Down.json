    "reviewBody": "Is this even considered as a full length movie or just a short film. I mean the way they have shot the film with ipads & iphones with a basic plot and considering covid is a good move but nothing interesting to watch instead of a boring affair and a broken marriage. I mean common even if you are shooting with mobile phones that doesn&apos;t mean you gonna show the same old generation old story that none of us are not interested to watch. I&apos;m literally laughing in the entire movie and was guessing like what the hell is going on I mean yes covid life was tough but people were already bored and this movie will also bore you on another level.\n\nThis movie is only for those who hasn&apos;t experience the covid situation rest of them can ignore....",
