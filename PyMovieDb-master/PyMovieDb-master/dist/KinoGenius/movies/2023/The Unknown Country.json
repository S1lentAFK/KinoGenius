    "reviewBody": "I wanted to feel sympathy for the hero of the story but could just not bring myself to do so. The pace is too slow, the people she meets on her journey are stereotypical, and the hero herself says little and does even less. If this were to be written as a transformative journey, we would need character development before and after her trek. There is far too little.\n\nThere was a missed opportunity when the hero met some agreeable people her age and began engaging with them. But when others ask her very simple questions about her background and why she is undertaking a trip, she flatly refuses to answer anything. She was trying to be coy perhaps, but seemed guarded and aloof. If you set out to tell your story, tell your story.",
