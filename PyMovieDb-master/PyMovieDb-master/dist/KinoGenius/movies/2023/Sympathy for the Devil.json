    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t know how this movie got made, who wasn&apos;t bored to death reading that script, this is just bad lazy writing that can&apos;t be made into a good thriller even with the actors giving their best, the movie doesn&apos;t look cheap it&apos;s a decent looking movie at least the director and the staff weren&apos;t as lazy as the Writer I liked some of music choices but sometimes it felt the director had nothing to fill the movie with other than road shoots and a random song, I only continued watching for Cage and Joel I&apos;m sure anyone who is not a fan of them like myself will turn off this movie 20 minutes in. I think Nic Cage and Joel Kinnaman deserved a better movie.",
