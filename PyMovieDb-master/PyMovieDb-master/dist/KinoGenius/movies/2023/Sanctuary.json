    "reviewBody": "A sensually dominant vibrance paired with a comedically dark spotlight on the societal flaws that we&apos;ve created for gender roles. Margaret Qualley is an absolute movie star, showcasing a performance with utter confidence in her range and complete control with her emotions. Her chemistry with Christopher Abbott is sharp and timely with a specific whit that is admirable yet terrifying at times with purposeful misdirection. The environment is predominantly stationary, only ever expanding between a couple rooms and a hallway within a hotel, but the pacing remains tense and the score seeps in desperately for a deeply fascinating experience. An ambiguous introduction that is properly complemented by a satisfying conclusion.",
