    "reviewBody": "One-sentence summary: Two years after the events of the first film, Becky finds herself at the center of a small-town insurrection with far-reaching implications.\n\nIn all honesty, it never crossed my mind that Becky (2020) would get a sequel, so it took me by complete surprise when I saw that The Wrath of Becky was playing at my local theater. The story is a standard mishmash of previously successful movies. Think John Wick meets Home Alone. Nevertheless, the filmmakers nailed the tone and style, balancing the lighthearted fun and brutal violence nicely. The script could&apos;ve been a tad tighter, but I admire how they continue to offer longtime comedic actors an opportunity to demonstrate their range. Even if Seann William Scott doesn&apos;t quite match Kevin James&apos; performance from the first film, he is still one of the biggest reasons to watch the sequel. I&apos;m not going to tell you to move this to the top of your watchlist, but The Wrath of Becky is a fun way to kill 90 minutes.",
