    "reviewBody": "The Fnaf movie was a rollercoaster of mixed feelings. Part of the film is fun and thrilling, but the otherside of the plot feels rushed and has nit picky issues many will see.\n\nAs someone who played the games and knows the story, for the casual fans this may be quite a confusing and the horror element is missing due to the age cap. It did not give me the same thrills the games gave. The animatronics are well designed and planned out but the movie pacing and plot will really annoy a majority. Some of the characters feel almost lifeless. The game element was missing with cameras, lights and power.",
