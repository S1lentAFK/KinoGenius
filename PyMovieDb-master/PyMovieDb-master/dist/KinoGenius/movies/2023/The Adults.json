    "reviewBody": "I like(d) Michael Cera (the leading actor) comical charisma before in many other movies, one being in Barbie recently. Michael Cera was even producer of this movie himself so he must have had a lot of cloud to mold this movie, but it unfortunately fell flat.\n\nThe bad: it isnst a comedy, not even a quirky one. It isnt a drama for sure either. It is some sort of slowburning and BLAND portrait of 3 siblings (1 brother, 2 sisters) who get together again after a long time no see.\n\nNo surprising storyline. No original direction. No impressive technical details (sound, photography). No actor&apos;s chemistry.\n\nI guess they wanted to create a quirky, comical personal portrait, but they failed big time...",
