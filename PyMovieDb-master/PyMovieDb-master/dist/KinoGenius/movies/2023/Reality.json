    "reviewBody": "Having access to secret things that should be known, presenting opportunities, when you&apos;re alone, to print out, stuff down your clothes, specifically, your pantyhose, then send it off to those, who get your cover blown; it all leads to a tense visit from the boys, who at school must have resented those with toys, as all they love is the pursuit, of those they want to prosecute, probing, intimidate, is how they get their joys; so the service you&apos;ve performed to wake, enlighten, ends up with a noose that&apos;s subtly gets tightened, then your cast into a cell, it&apos;s quite a long time (by some distance) that you dwell, but those with a sense of right, will surely fight on.\n\nSydney Sweeny is outstanding, absolutely brilliant, as the persecuted Reality Winner who did the right thing.",
