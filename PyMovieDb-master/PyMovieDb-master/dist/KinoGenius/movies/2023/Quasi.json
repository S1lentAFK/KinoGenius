    "reviewBody": "&apos;Quasi&apos;, the imaginative retelling of the Hunchback of Notre Dame, features Steve Lemme as the title character, Quasi Modo - a torturer who grew up in the clock tower. Through a series of events, Quasi and his friend Duchamp (Kevin Heffernan) attempt to create an equal France by way of getting oysters for the peasants, and in doing so, is face the ire of King Guy (Jay Chandrasekhar) and Pope Cornelius (Paul Soter).\n\nThe film is made with the crew from Broken Lizard and has most of the elements that make their films funny, but falls short. The script is a bit lackluster, but the flow is decent. It&apos;s worth a few laughs and is amusing, but not their greatest work.\n\nWorth a once over.",
