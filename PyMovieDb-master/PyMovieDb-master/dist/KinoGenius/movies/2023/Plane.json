    "reviewBody": "I love films like this where there&apos;s no confusing plot, no hidden agendas, no shock twists. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I enjoy those kind of films as well, but sometimes I just want to sit back and enjoy a movie for it&apos;s entertainment value instead of doing in-depth analysis.\n\n&apos;Plane&apos; has a simple premise (just as the title indicates, I suppose). It is a disaster story, and a film about survival. Gerard Butler stars as Captain Brodie Torrance who flies from Singapore to Tokyo. There are only 14 passengers on board, including fugitive Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter), and 3 cabin crew. Not knowing what to expect from Gaspare, this character allowed for some tension from the beginning.\n\nBrodie is forced to make an emergency landing during a fierce storm. They soon discover they landed on an island run by criminals, and there is no law and order. They have no radio, and no working phones, and they desperately need to find help. So Brodie and Gaspare brave the forest to find help.\n\n&apos;Plane&apos; is fast-paced and became more and more intense by the minute. There&apos;s loads of action, gunfire, and suspense, and very good character development. This is also a very physical role for Gerard Butler, and I thought he did it wonderfully. Mike Colter also makes a credible hero.\n\nFair enough, the film probably won&apos;t be winning any awards, but this is an entertaining movie well worth seeing.",
