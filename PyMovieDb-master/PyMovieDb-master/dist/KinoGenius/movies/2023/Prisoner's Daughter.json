    "reviewBody": "This was unexpectedly entertaining; I think I can congratulate the film makers on successfully breaking out of the infamous Hollywood comfort zone and for a refreshing change trying to show real-world people dealing with the bad choices they have made and the price it cost their families.\n\nPros: \n* characters we could relate to (at last!)\n* well paced and believable story\n\n\nCons: \n* story a bit old and cliched\n* shaky camera (not again!)\n* female lead&apos;s fake lips on top of quite visible makeup that contradicted her role\n* too sugary sometimes\n\n\nI&apos;m rating it 6 but it&apos;s actually a compliment coming from me. Most movies these days I don&apos;t even bother to rate and turn off after 10 to 15 minutes of runtime.",
