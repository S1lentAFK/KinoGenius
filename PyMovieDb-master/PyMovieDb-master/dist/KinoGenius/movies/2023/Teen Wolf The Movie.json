    "reviewBody": "The Teen Wolf TV show was a pretty good series, especially the first 3 seasons, with season 3 being brilliant. Like seriously, season 3 of Teen Wolf had no right to be as good as it was. Season 4-6 were, fine, not bad, not great. The Teen Wolf Movie is more or less the same. There are plently of great things here and there in this movie, but overall, it falls short on many aspects. It&apos;s not bad by any means, but it just feels like 2 episodes of the original show mashed into 2.5 hours. It doesn&apos;t feel like a movie, and that comes down to the direction and very weird editing. Being 2.5 hours long, this &apos;movie&apos; feels very rushed, especially during the first half an hour. We bounce between our old main characters, and don&apos;t really spend all that much time with them within their normal lives. The movie could have spared more time to show us what these great characters have been doing for the past 5 years, or 7 years in the movie. Not much happens action wise, not until the last act, but even then the action scenes are very underwhelming. Scott, Malia, Derek, Peter, Chris and Lydia do almost nothing throughout the entire movie. Allison is pretty much the main character here. While she isn&apos;t bad, and the way they brought her back wasn&apos;t too far fetched by Teen Wolf standards, I feel like they spent too much time with her, and not with our main heroes. Which makes me believe this movie should have been a mini series with maybe 6 episodes. To flesh out the story a little better. What made the original show so brilliant, was its characters. Scott, Stiles, Lydia, Allison, Coach and Sheriff Stilinski are brilliant, but here they feel so under used, with the execption of Allison.\n\nA lot of the main characters from the original show are just there for show, like Jackson and Mason, who do absolutely nothing, and I feel like Jackson was just there to sort of replace Stiles as the comic relief. Which of course brings me to the biggest complaint. No Stiles. (Sigh). We all know Dylan wasn&apos;t coming back, and I was expecting the movie to feel empty without him, and it sure does. Without Stiles this movie feels hollow, it has no heart. You can&apos;t bring back the best villains in the series, and not have Stiles, who played such a vital part in that storyline back in season 3. It just doesn&apos;t make sense. The excuse for him not turning up was pretty lame as well. There is a main death in this movie, and I saw it coming months ago, but the way it was handled was poor. It didn&apos;t feel emotional like I was expecting it to be. Just rushed, and by the end of it, I felt nothing at all. Not having Kira and replacing her with a cardboard cut out, was also irritating. Hikari was clearly supposed to be Kira, so when we see this random girl appear, we feel nothing at all, and her screen time with Liam is non existant, which can be frustrating, since the movie wants us to believe they are a couple.\n\nThose are the main issues with the movie. Now I know it seems like I&apos;m dumping on this film hard, but there are loads of good things here. The acting, especially by Tyler is very good. He&apos;s really upped his skills as an actor since the original show and he does a fantastic job and showing his emotion and pain on screen. The fight scenes, while sparse are well filmed. The Nogitsune is again, a great villain. They handled the whole thing very well, and if you brush up on your history and rewatch season 1-3, the villain elevates even more. There are also some really good scenes with Scott and Allison, some of which could put a lump in your throat. Their on screen relationship during the original show was outstanding, and is one of the best TV relationships. And Teen Wolf The Movie does a pretty decent job with it.\n\nSo in all, the movie is good, not great, but better than most movies made from a TV show. It would have benefitted from being a mini series, to have had more fight scenes, but it&apos;s still a good watch. If you loved the original show, then you will of course, really enjoy this. Hopefully we get another movie, or maybe a series in the future, because I forgot just how much I like these characters, and have kinda missed them.\n\n6/10.",
