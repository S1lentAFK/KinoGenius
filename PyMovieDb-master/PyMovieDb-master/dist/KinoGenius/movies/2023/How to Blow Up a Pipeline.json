    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a tense movie with some good moments, interesting cinematography, and an even better score. However, it didn&apos;t live up to the high expectations.\n\nEven I, who agree with the main message, found it to be too one-sided. Other perspectives are not heard, there are no arguments, no pros and cons (when there are - and only about the method - a conclusion is quickly reached). I like movies that make me reflect and not movies that feed me the message with a spoon, forcing me to accept that. The structure is interesting, although cutting the tension doesn&apos;t always have the desired effect (which I believe is the same as a cliffhanger on tv shows). Lastly, the characters are too linear, too victimized. We know almost nothing about what sets them apart, we are only left with their motivations - all with direct causes - to do what they want to do. Ok, but didn&apos;t make me care a lot about them.\n\nIt&apos;s an ok, flawed, somewhat interesting little thriller with an important message, but that&apos;s all it is.",
