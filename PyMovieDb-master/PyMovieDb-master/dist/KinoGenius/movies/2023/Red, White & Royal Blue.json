    "reviewBody": "This movie was a HUGE shock to me, it was so very beautiful and it made me cry!! I was not expecting much, as I&apos;m an older lady who does not often watch &apos;young people&apos;s&apos; movies because I invariably find them uninteresting (to me). But this film is SO well done and has such a lovely and relevant story, that I was hooked from the very start!! The 2 lead actors are amazing in their roles, both very believable. The production values are first class, and the story highlights SUCH an important issue in our world today - that of TOLERANCE & ACCEPTANCE of others. We are each a UNIQUE creation, and consensual adult love in all its forms should be celebrated. There is so much hatred, bigotry and suffering in the world today, we need more films that bring us together, like this one. Congratulations and Thanks to all involved in its creation!!",
