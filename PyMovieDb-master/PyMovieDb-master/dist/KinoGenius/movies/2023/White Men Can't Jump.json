    "reviewBody": "The original was more raw and a decent representation of the times.\n\nThe new version is also good representation of the times, but feels less raw and has Hollywood polish all over it. It&apos;s hilarious that this qualifies as an rated R movie when it seems more like a PG or G rated movie.\n\nThere were some laughs and the story was okay, but don&apos;t expect too many similarities or a connection to the original. The only thing that was similar was that there was a black and white guy that randomly team up to enter a 2 on 2 basketball tournament. Everything else was pretty different.\n\nI wish Disney/Fox would stop remaking classics to make a quick buck off of fans. It&apos;s disappointing because they&apos;re ruining the memories people have of the original versions.\n\nIf you have nothing better to watch then it&apos;s a decent time filler, but don&apos;t dedicate your time to watching it.\n\nI don&apos;t think it&apos;s a 1/10 rating, but it&apos;s certainly not above a 6/10 rating. I&apos;d put it around a 3 or 4 out of 10 rating. The characters were likeable, so I went with 4.",
