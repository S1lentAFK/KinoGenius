    "reviewBody": "PROS: Strong performances from most of the cast. A solid set up in the first block of the film that makes us empathize with the characters.\n\nCONS: After the set up and possessions, the film flatlines. There seem to be too many ideas floating around that never get handled properly. The creepy factor was null and void. A couple of jump scares are thrown in. Perhaps the film&apos;s biggest mistake is having the legacy character, Chris (Ellen Burstyn), wasted here as the studio&apos;s cliche cash grab for nostalgic fans. An overall weak script, cringe dialogue, and plenty of corny group exorcism moments to go around. The film really treats its audience like they&apos;re stupid. Skip this and watch the original instead.",
