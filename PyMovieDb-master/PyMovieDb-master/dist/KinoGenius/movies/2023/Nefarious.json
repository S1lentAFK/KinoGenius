    "reviewBody": "I frequently despise movies that are entirely dialogue-based, where nothing really happens aside from the conversations. But with Nefarious, I was locked in on that dialogue from beginning to end.\n\nThis was partly accomplished with good writing. The conversations are interesting and seem strategic by the characters. But the biggest reason it works is the performance by Sean Patrick Flanery. The entire success of this movie rides on him.\n\nHe knocks it out of the park. His performance is so good, so convincing. I couldn&apos;t take my eyes off of it. As I wondered why this talent hasn&apos;t launched him to bigger roles, I went back and looked at his history. I&apos;ve only seen him in Dexter and Saw VII (aka Saw 3D). I have no idea how he hasn&apos;t earned bigger roles. The only reasonable explanation would be that he just recently developed this level of skill, which is possible but hard to believe.\n\nI enjoyed Nefarious overall, despite most of the movie being very slow. But I did wish there was a little more that would push it past the threshold of being a great movie that I would want to rewatch. I also think the listed genres of horror and thriller are highly misleading. It&apos;s neither. If I had to choose, I would describe it as a creepy drama.\n\n(1 viewing, opening Thursday 4/13/2023)",
