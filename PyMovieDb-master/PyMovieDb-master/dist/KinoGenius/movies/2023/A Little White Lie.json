    "reviewBody": "The film is a witty and clever satire of the literary world, poking fun at its pretensions, rivalries, and scandals. The film also explores themes such as identity, fame, love, and truth. The film benefits from its talented cast, especially Shannon who plays Leo with charm and humor. He makes us root for him even when he is clearly deceiving everyone around him. Hudson is also delightful as Simone, who balances her professional duties with her personal feelings for Leo.\n\nA Little White Lie is a fun and entertaining film that will make you laugh out loud at its absurd situations and hilarious dialogues. It is a film that will appeal to fans of comedy and literature alike.",
