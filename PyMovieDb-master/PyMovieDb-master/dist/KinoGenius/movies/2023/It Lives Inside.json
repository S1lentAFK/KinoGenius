    "reviewBody": "I saw It Lives Inside early as part of Regal&apos;s Mystery Movie Monday. I already had it on my watchlist so I was happy with the choice. The outcome though, not so much.\n\nIt takes a long while to get going, for the story to progress, and to see anything scary. Even when it does get going, it&apos;s fairly underwhelming aside from one scene in the middle. After that scene, I felt mildly positive about the movie. But I found the third act and conclusion to be a huge letdown. And the movie overall feels ordinary within the horror genre.\n\nPart of the reason the horror elements feel weak is the PG-13 rating. This movie should have absolutely been rated R. If they weren&apos;t restricted, some of these scenes could have been shocking. They sometimes do a decent job of pushing the limits or creatively showing what they can. But it&apos;s not enough and feels like it&apos;s holding back.\n\nThere are some good elements here. And I can see some people liking this. But it just didn&apos;t do it for me. It reminded me of a significantly restrained and much worse version of Smile. Watch that instead.\n\n(1 viewing, early screening Mystery Movie Monday 9/4/2023)",
