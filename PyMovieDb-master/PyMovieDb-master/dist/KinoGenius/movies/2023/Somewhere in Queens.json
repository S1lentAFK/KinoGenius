    "reviewBody": "All of the other reviews have touched upon just how funny, touching and well acted this movie is. I would like to further add that the characters, family chemistry and the timing of the dialogue was outstanding. It rivals Moonstruck with its situational comedy, and it occasionally exceeds it. The real deal for me were the depth of the family secrets, how they bubbled to the surface and the pain/hurt that can be inflicted. It was raw and painful. Frankly, I couldn&apos;t see how they could overcome it. However, this movie really shines when it shows the strength of the family, how they overcome it and actual grow from it. I can&apos;t say anything more without giving away something so I would strongly encourage you to see it for yourself.",
