    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t like to be that person who says the book was better, but in this case I couldn&apos;t enjoy the film because I had read the book. The film felt rushed and it lacked deepness: the story, the characters and the relations between them lacked deepness. Everything happened really fast and what we got to see from the main character&apos;s childhood wasn&apos;t enough. Since it lacked deepness, some moments seemed like they made no sense.\n\nMy boyfriend hadn&apos;t read the book, but he went to see the film with me and he also felt like it was rushed and that they just tried to summarize a complex story with complex characters.\n\nIt&apos;s a very good story though and it will keep you entertained, specially if you know nothing about it. Also the acting isn&apos;t bad at all. I give it a 6 based on the film itself, ignoring the existence of the book.\n\nAnyway, I hope you get to enjoy it.",
