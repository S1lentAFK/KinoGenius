    "reviewBody": "Richard Galloway (Matt Smith) and his gay partner Dally Margolis (Caleb Landry Jones) have created a private resort in the Moroccan desert. Hard-drinking surgeon David Henninger (Ralph Fiennes) and his wife Jo (Jessica Chastain) are two of their guests. In the dark of night, David gets lost driving to the resort. He hits and kills a local boy.\n\nThis reminds me of the TV show, The White Lotus. The guests are entitled and selfish. They make many assumptions about the locals. The locals have their own prejudices. It&apos;s a clash of cultures and classes. It raises uncomfortable questions about people. Unlike White Lotus, this does not use as much ironic humor and has the intensity raised up especially in David&apos;s journey. I could do with less Jo. Once David is headed out into the desert, the resort life holds much less importance.",
