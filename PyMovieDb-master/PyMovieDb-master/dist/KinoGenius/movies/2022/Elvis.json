    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s probably not the best biopic ever made but I personally loved this take on Elvis. I loved that it exposed The Colonel&apos;s abuse and gave some insight to just how much Elivs worked for the benefit of others. He took care of everyone.\n\nI&apos;m not gonna give a long review. I just wanted to share how good I thought it was. Austin Butler deserves an award for how brilliant he was in this role. I saw where some reviewers were complaining about him not looking closely enough like Elvis but I thought he was a nice fit. There was only one Elvis folks. We just have to work with what we have and as I mentioned, I believe Austin deserves an award. He put serious thought and effort into playing this role. He wasn&apos;t hard on the eyes either!! Great Job!!\n\nLoved it!",
