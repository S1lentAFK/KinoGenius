    "reviewBody": "So if I had to balance this movie in-between 2 spots it would have to be high school drama and metal music. This movie has a taste of both and it is not boring or uninteresting at all. Loved it and will totally see it again, if only for the music. Loved the acting and thought Mr. Martel is coming into his own very well. Cannot wait to see what he is in next!",
