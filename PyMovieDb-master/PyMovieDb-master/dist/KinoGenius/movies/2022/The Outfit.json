    "reviewBody": "Suspend your disbelief - it is possible to do so. Especially because the actors and the setting is so well chosen, that you will just fit right into it. No pun intended - and even though there are certain things that seem quite coincidental and based on luck rather on skill or whatever else you would want to call it, the movie and the characters in it, really draw you in - I guess that could also be considered a pun.\n\nWhile the not tailor (don&apos;t call him that, he is a cutter) is at the center of the story and many things seem simple ... there are quite a few revelations that might be able to surprise you. Again do not worry about what makes sense or not too much - just enjoy how well woven it all is - ah another pun. Well I can&apos;t help it, it feels good when I put them on and they work like a charm ... charm(e) also something that can be said about the actors involved in this. Not many people in it, but those who are give it their best ... great thriller, with touches of evil and Hitchcock ...",
