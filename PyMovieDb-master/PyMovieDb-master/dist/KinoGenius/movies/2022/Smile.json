    "reviewBody": "A creepy therapist lady makes a bad choice picking out a present for her nephews b-day, and the party goers are left speechless. The therapist can&apos;t understand her sister losing her head over an obvious mistake. She needs to take a break from work but she just mopes around her house arguing with her fiancé and drinking wine. She catches her fiancé with another woman, so ends up with her ex, who is a policeman. They download and print gory photos of smiling dead people. She visits a dude in prison for murder who gives her a clue about life, but he is not happy to see her. Will the boy understand the odd birthday gift? Will the therapist and her ex get back together or will her mother interfere? These questions and more will become more confusing as you watch this critically acclaimed movie.",
