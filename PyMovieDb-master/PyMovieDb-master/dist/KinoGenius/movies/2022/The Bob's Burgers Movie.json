    "reviewBody": "The Bob&apos;s Burgers Movie meets expectations. It&apos;s funny, purposeful, and developed enough to maintain investment. Fundamentally, it&apos;s a murder mystery, but also intertwines Bob&apos;s money issues (which is the emotional force). Plus, Louise is intrinsically motivated to prove her bravery, making her the main protagonist and giving her the clearest arc. Bob&apos;s Burgers doesn&apos;t have the tightest crafted humor, but these dynamic characters help it connect emotionally. The film is still lighthearted and silly (with skilled setup and payoff), but it peppers in enough drama to create substance. Thus, Bob&apos;s Burgers succeeds because it delivers a sincere combination of laughs and relatability.\n\nTechnically, Bob&apos;s Burgers is proficient. Surprisingly, there are musical numbers that heighten the soundtrack, cinematography, editing, and direction. There is dramatic lighting, framing, and camerawork. Also, passing cuts, smash cuts, and time lapses help the comedic rhythm. Furthermore, voice acting is ranged, animation is personal, and CGI is supportive. Punchlines are heightened by exaggerated music, transitions, and surrealism. Overall, the filmmaking reinforces the humorous mood. It isn&apos;t high art, but it possesses consistent craft. Therefore, Bob&apos;s Burgers is a fairly enjoyable experience. Viewers should expect skilled comedy and decent emotions.\n\nWriting: 7/10 Direction: 6/10 Cinematography: 8/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Score/Soundtrack: 8/10 Production Design: 7/10 Casting: 7/10 Effects: 7/10\n\nOverall Score: 7.2/10.",
