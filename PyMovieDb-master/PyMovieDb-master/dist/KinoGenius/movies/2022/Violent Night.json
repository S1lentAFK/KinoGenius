    "reviewBody": "A wealthy family home is invaded by a group of criminals, their only hope is Santa Claus.\n\nI think this film may surprise a few, I was pleasantly surprised, action packed, violent, quietly amusing, I have a feeling that for those of us that adore Die Hard, and embrace it as a Christmas movie, this is probably going to be up your Street. I&apos;m not sure it&apos;s deserving of cult status, but don&apos;t ask me why, I have a feeling that in years to come, this may well develop something of a following.\n\nThe clue is in the title, Violent Night, and boy this film doesn&apos;t hold back, in terms of violence and manner of deaths, this film packs a real punch, you will see all sorts, people dismembered, shot, impaled, it really doesn&apos;t hold back.\n\nIf Santa did actually pop down for a visit, I can imagine him being this disillusioned, this irritated, with a genuinely low opinion of people, this is where the film scores in my opinion, the performance of David Harbour, who is genuinely very good.\n\nEnjoyable music throughout, good special effects, plenty of action, Violent Night was a Christmas surprise.\n\n7/10.",
