    "reviewBody": ": Oh my gosh, I cannot believe the people who gave this funny funny movie such a poor rating. Good acting and some really really funny scenes are the highlights of this one. I found myself laughing out loud on so many occasions. The premise is of course unethical but hardly untrue unfortunately. All of the characters nail their roles and are so funny. I honestly don&#39;t know what some people are expecting from such a movie to be honest. If you need a comedy break in your viewing schedule, i highly recommend seeing this film, you won&#39;t be disappointed.\n\nTo IMDb reviewers. Why have you rejected this review? It has nothing insulating to anyone in it!!!",
