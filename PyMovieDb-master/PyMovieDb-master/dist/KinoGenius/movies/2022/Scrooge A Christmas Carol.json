    "reviewBody": "Did we need another A Christmas Carol film? No, probably not.\n\nWas this worth it? Just for Luke Evans vocals alone I&apos;d 100% say yes. Some of the songs were spectacular.\n\nThe animation was great, with exciting new imaginations of scenes. I think it was a successful modernisation of an over saturated film and will definitely get younger kids enjoying it, but maybe not enough to stand out alone if it wasn&apos;t a musical. There wasn&apos;t enough emphasis on some of the other characters stories, so you don&apos;t build much of an emotional connection with them. Some of the accents were pretty bad, and parts of the original script and wording is lost, which is important to its essence.\n\nDespite that, it&apos;s enjoyable, and after all it&apos;s a children&apos;s film. I will be going back to replay Luke Evan&apos;s singing solos on repeat.",
