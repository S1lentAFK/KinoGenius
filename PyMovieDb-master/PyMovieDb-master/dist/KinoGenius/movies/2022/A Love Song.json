    "reviewBody": "While the cinematography showed nice views the picture was not that great. However, this film absolute blew me away; each scene was special! If you are not looking for action then please check out this film (if you are expecting action then this is not the film for you). It moves at a snails pace throughout while the set never much really changes. If you don&apos;t like camping then go watch this movie instead;)",
