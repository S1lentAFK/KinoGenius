    "reviewBody": "... because it is as cheesy as they get. This was incredibly predictable from literally the first shot. If you&apos;re looking for an original storyline, this is not it. You pretty much know exactly what&apos;s going to happen just from the trailer. However, seeing Lindsay Lohan acting again and being happy is a Christmas miracle in and of itself. And Chord Overstreet is looking adorably handsome in this. On top of it, their chemistry is pretty good too. And even though this was brutally cheesy and predicatble it somehow managed to get me to tear up a little.. twice!! So yeah... i probably wont even remember watching this a few days from now it was still a good time. And honestly, I think Lindsey deserves a second chance at her career. I hope it takes off again and she&apos;s able to get bigger and better roles in the future. But this was definitely a cute little comeback.",
