    "reviewBody": "The result is a movie that is less thought-provoking and more aggressively lame. Hemsworth&apos;s charismatic persona and Teller&apos;s dramatic performance are not enough to keep this film afloat. Everything culminates in a bonkers final act that&apos;s surprisingly awful. Once again, the tone is all over the place as the film ends with a jarring shift to a needle-drop action sequence that feels all over the place in a so-bad-it&apos;s-good way. What had the potential to be a darkly funny, suspenseful, claustrophobic sci-fi story amounts to none of that, leading to a colossal miscalculation that you won&apos;t care for once the credits roll.",
