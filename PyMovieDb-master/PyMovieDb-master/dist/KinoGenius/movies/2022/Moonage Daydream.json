    "reviewBody": "Saw this movie on Cannes Film Festival. It was more than beautiful. Bowie was such a legend. Seeing all those scenes and songs made me feel like I was a teenager again. Although this film was nearly two hours and a half long, it wasn&apos;t boring at all. Definetly consider watching it when it comes to cinemas on 16th of September. David&apos;s face is literally so gorgerous and I recommend watching Man Who Fell To Earth (1976). It isn&apos;t great as this movie/documentary, But definetly worth watching.\n\nXoxo Diana.",
