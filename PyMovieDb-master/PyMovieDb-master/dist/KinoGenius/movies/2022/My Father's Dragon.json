    "reviewBody": "A boy in a struggling household gets in a fight with hit single mother and runs away. He ends up exploring a magical world that transforms his perspective on things. An island that keeps sinking needs the boys help. His struggle to save the island helps him become an adult. A very artistic way of representing the boys real life problems and the benefits he&apos;ll receive from his current real life struggles. The visuals are great. I was impressed by this story line. Addresses real life family issues. Very magical and lots of fun. Great messaging and plenty of excitement to keep a young person interested I absolutely recommend watching this with the family.",
