    "reviewBody": "Ice Age hasn&apos;t been good since the third installment. Now first off, I like Buck Wild. But everything else is bad. The animation is lazy, and normally ice ages animation is the best thing about it. But this animation looked underbudget. The two possums are annoying and aren&apos;t main character material at all. And the jokes are lazily done. Overall its just your typical run of the mill Ice Age sequel but with worse animation.",
