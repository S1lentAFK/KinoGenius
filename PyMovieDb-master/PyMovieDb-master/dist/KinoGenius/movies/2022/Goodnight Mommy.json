    "reviewBody": "Elias and Lucas arrive at their mother&apos;s house, to find her wearing a mask, and feeling very much like a stranger.\n\nOnce again, we get another remake, another remake that pales in comparison compared to its source material. The Austrian film is Chilling and unnerving, this was quite a pale remake.\n\nNo issues at all with the acting, competently performed, with a strong performance from the excellent Naomi Watts, and very good acting from the boys also.\n\nThey could have upped the horror vibe a few degrees, it just doesn&apos;t grip the viewer, for a so called horror, it&apos;s all too flat, and by the time something happens, the film is almost over.\n\nSome good special effects, the nightmare sequences looked really good, but such horror moments were too few and far between.\n\nJust watch the original, it&apos;s far superior.\n\n5/10.",
