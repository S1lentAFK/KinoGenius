    "reviewBody": "The concept behind the movie was great. It had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it was carried out poorly. I&apos;ve seen better acting in YouTube videos and TikToks. But this was like those pimple popping videos, you don&apos;t want to see it, but you can&apos;t stop watching.\n\nIf it had bee made by another service, it would have been better. It&apos;s a case of you get what you pay for. Tubi is free, they rely on ad revenue. If Prime or Netflix had picked up the movie, I think it would have been much better.",
