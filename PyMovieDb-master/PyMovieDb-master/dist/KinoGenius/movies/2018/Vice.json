    "reviewBody": "Saw &apos;Vice&apos; for quite a few reasons. The subject was fascinating as is Dick Cheney himself. That it was positively reviewed, well mostly, and got the awards attention it did (yes, have always taken the big awards more seriously than others because while there have been questionable wins and even nominations in every category every year there are just as many that are richly deserved), showed a lot of promise.\n\nAlso really liked 2015&apos;s &apos;The Big Short&apos;, another positively reviewed Adam McKay film, and what was especially good in that film also came over to me as particularly good here in &apos;Vice&apos;. My main reason though, and this seems to be true of a lot of films seen recently (both those released this year and first time viewings for all years), was the cast. Hard to go wrong with Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Sam Rockwell and Steve Carrell (who is good and more with good material).\n\nWhile full potential is not fully achieved and it is a bit uneven and messy, a larger part of me really enjoyed &apos;Vice&apos;, which did impress me with its ambition and invention. It is a film that will hugely entertain a good number while challenging others, and will be and is even a polarising experience more than understandably. As said it is a long way from perfect and between this and &apos;The Big Short&apos; the latter is the better film. Am going to agree with those that criticised the editing, which does go too over the top on the intended quirkiness and like it was trying too hard to be inventive and it comes over as choppy instead.\n\nThe story execution, while mostly compelling, does suffer zig zagging to and fro too much, which gave it an unfocused feel that didn&apos;t always make the film feel cohesive. So it did come over as a bit rushed and muddled at times, and it definitely could have benefitted from trying to do less and not go over the top on the details. Was a little mixed on the narration, it has a lot of clever moments (and was not expecting the twist regarding it) but there were times where it wasn&apos;t necessary and intruded a bit.\n\n&apos;Vice&apos; however has a lot that is good. Although there were reservations with the editing, there was some quite audacious photography that succeeds better at being inventive and the production/locations and costuming show great care in making the time and place clear. The best thing though visually was the makeup for Cheney, which was a masterstroke and rendered Bale unrecognisable. The film is tightly directed by McKay and the music is a beautiful mix of melancholic and uplifting. While the story is not flawless by any stretch, it is still very compelling even when more deliberate than &apos;The Big Short&apos; and told with great gusto. It is a tough and very relevant subject, handled in a way that hits hard. Two things are especially good in &apos;Vice&apos; though.\n\nOne is the script, which is often darkly hilarious, unsettling in its frank truth, very informative even though the amount told to us is vast and bleakly tragic. The other is the cast, with all the actors on point and make their characters well rounded (the negative portrayal of Cheney though is polarising, his family objected to it, and some may find it on the biased side, but to me he avoids caricature). Bale is magnificent, one of his best performances this decade and it shocked me seeing him this cold and menacing. Adams is just as powerful a presence and their chemistry is eerily twisted. Rockwell is always great and Carrell is fun to watch while never resorting to silliness. Tyler Perry shows too that his performance in &apos;Gone Girl&apos;, a brilliant film and he was surprisingly good in it, wasn&apos;t a fluke in an another relatively against type role.\n\nIn a nutshell, good but not great. 7/10",
