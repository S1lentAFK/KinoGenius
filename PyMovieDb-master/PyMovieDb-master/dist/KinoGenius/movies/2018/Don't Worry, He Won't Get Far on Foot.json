    "reviewBody": "From a technical viewpoint, very well executed - lighting and Cinematography were excellent. As for writing - every character in this is so well conveyed that the actors are able to do the story justice. Joaquin Phoenix did an excellent job as expected - both him and Jonah Hill really showed some emotional range in their roles. Rooney Mara&apos;s performance was great and her chemistry with Mr. Callahan was palpable; although not nearly as much so as Mr. Callahan&apos;s screen chemistry with Donny. Even the time Jack Black and Joaquin have on screen together is magical - and weirdly enough I don&apos;t think they could&apos;ve cast anyone better for Jack Black&apos;s character.\n\nThe movie ended up being more of an exploration of 12 step program than I expected, but by the end it actually gave me deeper insight and understanding of those struggling with alcoholism who seek help. Knowing tons of people who&apos;ve gone through the program (recurring ones and success stories) it&apos;s given me a slightly deeper appreciation for anyone&apos;s struggle/experience.",
