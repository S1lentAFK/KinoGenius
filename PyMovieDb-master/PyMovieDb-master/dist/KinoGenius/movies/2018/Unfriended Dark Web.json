    "reviewBody": "The first movie, Unfriended wasn&apos;t good at all, I didn&apos;t find it scary and felt it should have been labeled a thriller instead of Horror. The first did have good graphics and concept but the execution was meh. Dark Web however is much more effective and though I didn&apos;t find it scary like a horror movie, I do think it&apos;s a great thriller. The storyline and acting was much better and more effective than the first.",
