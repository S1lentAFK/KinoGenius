    "reviewBody": "Perhaps no other film in 2018 has exemplified true human emotion like Leave no Trace. It&apos;s immensely impressive how well director Debra Granik manages to make these characters feel like real people, even if you don&apos;t know anyone who lives out in the woods full time. I mean really, the location isn&apos;t necessarily important, what&apos;s important is that they have a home and that home was taken from them while another home is forced upon them. That&apos;s essentially the central part of the film, what&apos;s home to you may not be home to everyone. Ben Foster is unsurprisingly brilliant as is his daughter in the film, Thomasin McKenzie, who most certainly draws comparisons to Jennifer Lawrence (another Granik alum). Incredibly powerful and impeccably visceral, Leave no Trace is undoubtedly a film that will leave a trace come Oscar season.\n\n8.0/10",
