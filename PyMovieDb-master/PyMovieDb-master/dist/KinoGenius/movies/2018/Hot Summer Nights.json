    "reviewBody": "Small town local young heartthrob Cannabis seller teams up w/nerdy reject to expand his business. Nerd ends up over his head while also chasing the local female femme fatale. Acting was good; backdrop tunes were OK for the &apos;90s setup. Problems: A lot of wasted time on scenes that didn&apos;t contribute, i.e. overhead shots of a beach as well as a hurricane, and the sense of it being a hot Summer, none played a role in the story. In fact the hurricane, Bob, technically was a bust for a hurricane. A lot of the important character background was written & edited poorly, just sporadic bits here & there which made the story flow disruptive & confusing. Drug scenes, and party scenes were all pretty predictable. Major problem: The ending for all major characters went no where, and the death which occurs towards the end, could have been prevented knowing it&apos;s coming, and they have a gun. Didn&apos;t make any sense.",
