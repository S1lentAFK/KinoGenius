    "reviewBody": "One of a few great films out of San Diego, this monochromatic adaptation of Macbeth is soaked in blood. While the story follows its own path, this is a film ahead of its time. Character development, performances and storytelling are far more superior to some of Hollywood&apos;s big budgets still being made today. While this film has not hit the radar yet for its target audience, I am curious to see what this team is cooking up next. Shakespeare would be proud.",
