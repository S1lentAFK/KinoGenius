    "reviewBody": "I usually don&apos;t review movies unless I have a strong opinion. I was just baffled at people being so critical. This isn&apos;t some work of film, it&apos;s a comedy. Yes it is far fetched and unrealistic, but it&apos;s not meant to be some cohesive masterpiece, it&apos;s just comedy.\n\nI&apos;m very critical of comedy, but laughed throughout this entire movie. Sometimes in new comedy the endless one-liners get kind of tiring, but this one I was dying. Also when I watched the preview I wasn&apos;t convince it would be funny, so that almost deterred me also.",
