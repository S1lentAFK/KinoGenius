    "reviewBody": "What&apos;s going on with the soundtrack in this movie! It&apos;s absolutely terrible, like watching a movie with someone in the same room as you playing a cd , or watching a movie from 1940 with the volume turned up way to loud while you try to listen to the dialogue! And music playing completely inappropriate to the scene on screen , it&apos;s a shame it completely destroyed any chance of liking this movie .",
