    "reviewBody": "This is a very sweet story about an ape in captivity who lived for years in a shopping mall performing circus acts and he learns to paint and dreams of freedom where he can roam in the wild. The animals are friends and talk to one another and worry as business goes downhill with declining attendance. They embark on a courageous escape only to realize the wild isn&apos;t quite what they imagined. The CGI is well done as it looks realistic and the voice acting is fantastic as well. Overall the story is endearing especially as it&apos;s a true story.",
