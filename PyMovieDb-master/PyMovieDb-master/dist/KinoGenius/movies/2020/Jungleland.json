    "reviewBody": "Although Max Winkler&apos;s directing was decent, his story was slow, depressing, unsatisfying, and basically the story of every person who wasn&apos;t raised with a silver spoon. So you&apos;ll get nothing out of this except for a reality check on the lemons of life. I just wish the story had more punch than what the fists were giving. There were flaws, plot and technical issues in the screenplay. The 90 min runtime felt almost 3 hours long with the slow pacing. Performances however where outstanding, and the cinematography and score on point. It&apos;s a generous 7/10 from me.",
