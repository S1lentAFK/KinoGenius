    "reviewBody": "This movie makes sense when you know that it is mostly the writer-director&apos;s own story. She and her husband were in a bad automobile accident and when she regained consciousness she wouldn&apos;t see. Thus the title &apos;Wander Darkly.&apos; She developed that experience into this fictional story.\n\nThe couple are Sienna Miller as Adrienne and Diego Luna as Matteo. They are not married but decided to have a child who is a few months old when the movie starts. They have relationship baggage that needs to get sorted out and their accident is the catalyst for that.\n\nIt would be impossible for me to write a logical narrative after viewing the movie, in many ways it is like watching a series of dream sequences. However I enjoyed it, both lead actors are very good in their roles, especially Miller.\n\nI watched it at home on DVD from my public library. My wife skipped, she was on a golf trip.",
