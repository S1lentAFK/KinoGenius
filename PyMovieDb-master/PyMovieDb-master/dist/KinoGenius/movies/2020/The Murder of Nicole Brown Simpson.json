    "reviewBody": "Yes. It&apos;s that bad. Mena Suvari is the Exec Producer for this movie and I wonder where she received funding. This movie is not even worthy of a Lifetime showing. Terrible story, Terrible script, Terrible acting, and Terrible decision of mine to watch. I should have known better. Mena hasn&apos;t been in a good movie since American Beauty and it&apos;s amazing she&apos;s still around.",
