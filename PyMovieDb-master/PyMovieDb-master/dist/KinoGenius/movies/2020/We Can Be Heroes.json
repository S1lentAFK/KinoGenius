    "reviewBody": "The movie takes you back to the world of sharkboy and lavagirl but fails to be what we expected it to be. It&apos;s a kid movie and they may love it but definitely not for a mature audience. The plot is super predictable and and the CGI is awful. The only good thing about this film is Pedro Pascal.",
