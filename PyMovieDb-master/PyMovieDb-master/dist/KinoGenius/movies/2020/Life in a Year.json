    "reviewBody": "Life in a Year is predictable in a way, like most of these movies , but it tried to put its own spin on this story.\n\nJaden Smith is growing on me. You can tell he&apos;s talented and will keep growing as a performer. Cara is great like normal.\n\nSo don&apos;t listen to the overly negative reviews on here. That&apos;s just 2020 internet troll stuff. Most of these clowns on here just need something to do so they b-tch about everything. If you hate a certain type of movie, don&apos;t watch it. That&apos;s easier than watching it and then complaining about it. Me? I hate musicals. So I don&apos;t watch them and then blame the cast for me hating it. Get a life people.",
