    "reviewBody": "I really enjoyed this film. If I&apos;m honest it was my most anticipated film for September and let me tell you it was worth the wait. The film is split in 2 let&apos;s say with the first hour of build up and character inductions and right on the hour mark the real events finally begin and I laughed so hard, Emory is by far my favourite character and Hank came a close second. I love that the film tackled a number of things like depression, discrimination and the horrible truth of what it was like to be gay in the late 1960&apos;s. Jim parsons gives an outstanding performance as he always comes through but the acting that stood out for me was Zachery&apos;s, his presence filled each scene he was in and he really played this character so well from the body language, emotion and dialogue. The drama and comedy blend in so well together. I will absolutely return to this film over and over again.",
