    "heading": "Funny but just way too unrealistic",
    "reviewBody": "Pros: + Funny watch & suspense was good. + Features diverse characters. + Great if you want to watch something w/o having to think too much. Cons: There were a lot of highly unrealistic parts, which eventually became frustrating. E.g. there were so many situations where it was logical to do X, but for some reason she would do Y. Perhaps they could have avoided this by adding more depth to the storyline. E.g. if they had reasons to actively be in the same space. And perhaps if he was less obvious in how he went about it.",
