    "reviewBody": "Whilst this is a decent effort for a directional debut with a constant feeling of tension and uncomfortability, the R18+ rating and horror genre classification seems misplaced.\n\nThere&apos;s a real longing for a decent new horror film, and this isn&apos;t it.\n\nIf you&apos;ve seen every other horror film and have nothing better to do with time to kill, then give this film a watch... but if you don&apos;t get a chance to watch it, you&apos;re not really missing anything great.",
