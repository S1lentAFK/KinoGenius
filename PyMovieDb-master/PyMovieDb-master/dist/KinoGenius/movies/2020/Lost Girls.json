    "reviewBody": "Firstly, this being a true crime storyline, it&apos;s refreshing for a character study. The book was a tough read, and the film is no different. Strong cast, and a film that can&apos;t provide any real closure for the viewer. Netflix should make more films based on true crime stories. Lost Girls is a sad story and more focus is not a bad thing.",
