    "reviewBody": "Rubbish.\n\nVanessa Hudgens remains terrific, but &apos;The Princess Switch: Switched Again&apos; is disappointing in every other way. I enjoyed the first, but this is a let down. The plot is woeful, with the set-up and execution equally as bad. The new characters are lame, while what they do with the original lot is boring.\n\nThe new character is just annoying, not helped by how poorly they are written; as are the clich√©d goons alongside, though noteworthy (for me) to see Ricky Norwood cast as one of them - Fatboy himself. iykyk. Elsewhere, the main bunch from the first film reprise their roles, with the exception of Alexa Adeosun as Olivia - which is a shame.\n\nI admit this isn&apos;t anything utterly terrible, I didn&apos;t dislike it massively. I wanted a better follow-up though, this is a rather lacklustre attempt. A third film has already begun filming, I&apos;ll likely watch it either way but hopefully it&apos;s an improvement on this.",
