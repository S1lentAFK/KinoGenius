    "reviewBody": "It started as a light, very light movie. However, ended with a cute little message, not more cute than the movie itself. Truthfully, the story was below average. It had very few tent poles, didn&apos;t really have negative characters although they tried them. Disney did a wonderful job with the lights they presented it with. Also, it was wonderfully edited and shot. It&apos;s quite musical too. The cast were amazing. If truth be told, our own Los Pollos Hermanos aka Gus Fring aka Giancarlo Espacito wasn&apos;t really needed in this simple sweet adorable movie. It seemed quite a waste of his stupendous abilities. Also, the Doctor from The Last Ship wasn&apos;t really required either. The movie is quite average, one time watch, however, should give a watch to experience it. I really enjoyed the experience of watching this beautifully crafted movie although it wasn&apos;t profoundly artistic. It is amazing to see how Disney created a good movie despite a below average story. It could make a few early teens cry too.\n\nDon&apos;t shy away from the message.",
