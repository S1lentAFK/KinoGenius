    "reviewBody": "High school senior Adam Petrazelli (Charlie Plummer) loves cooking but he starts hallucinating. After an incident, he is diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother Beth (Molly Parker) puts him on an experimental drug. Her boyfriend Paul (Walton Goggins) wants to put him in an institution. Instead, he&apos;s sent to a private Catholic school run by Sister Catherine (Beth Grant) where he&apos;s befriended by brilliant classmate Maya Arnez (Taylor Russell). He hides his situation from her. His medicine is interfering with his cooking. He does find relieve confessing to Father Patrick (Andy Garc√≠a).\n\nPlummer is a terrific young actor and this role fits him very neatly. Sometimes, this movie has a dark tone which reminds me of Donnie Darko. Other times, it&apos;s a slightly lighter teen romance. My main issue is his hallucinations. They could do more with those although I also want them to view the story from Beth and Maya&apos;s point of views at times which would require the elimination of the hallucinations. All in all, it&apos;s a compelling portrait of mental illness.",
