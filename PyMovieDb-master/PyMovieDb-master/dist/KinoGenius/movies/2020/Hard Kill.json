    "reviewBody": "Four writers and they still couldn&apos;t keep me awake. The struggle was real. It was 98 minutes and slow pacing of back and forth dumb endless gunfire hell, with major plot and technical issues. A Cub Scout could plan a better attack on the factory. The very little story that there was, was so cliched and insignificant, that you&apos;ll forget what the endless gun battle was for. Even the dialogue was infantile. Apparently this was filmed in 10 days... what did they do for 8 of those days? Then there&apos;s the terrible acting, mainly due to the director failing to direct their cast - as well as the entire film. Lala Kent was the only convincing actor - and she was easier on the eyes than her acting abilities, if that tells you about the rest of the cast. And why is Willis still in these garbage films anyway? It&apos;s not for the money, because there&apos;s no way he&apos;ll be increasing his 250M net worth with these type of films. Bruce, please, stop. The only redeeming qualities was the cinematography and a half-decent score for a b-grade film. It&apos;s a very generous 3/10 from me.",
