    "reviewBody": "I appreciate the plethora of cast that returned for the sequel, but the humor fell flat for me. It was predictable and failed trying to recreate the humor of the first movie. The CGI left a lot to be desired as well.\n\nI hated giving this low of a rating, but it is what it is. Perhaps others will like it more.",
