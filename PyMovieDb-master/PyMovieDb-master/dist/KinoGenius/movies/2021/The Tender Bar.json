    "reviewBody": "There is a group of people who have troubled the cinema, and this mass is fed only by spreading negative energy.\n\nGeorge Clooney and Ben Affleck have been targeted by such people throughout their careers.\n\nThe film, which Clooney did a very clean job, attracts people especially with its 70&apos;s texture.\n\nIntelligently chosen actors and actresses, excellent selection of songs, cinematography, art direction are very good.\n\nThe script is already a book adaptation.\n\nTye Sheridan is my favorite generation Z actor. He showed her talent in this movie as well.\n\nA very good &apos;Coming of Age&apos; movie is waiting for you and the movie gives you more than what it promises in this sense.",
