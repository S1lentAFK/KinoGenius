    "reviewBody": "Stephen Hillenburg was heavily against a spinoff of any kind. This movie is just an introduction to the spinoff that will be called &apos;Camp Coral&apos;. While it&apos;s not prevelant at first, during the closing scenes it shifts from an animation movie to an ad. Most of the cast will be given a short clip of how they &apos;met&apos; spongebob through a flashback to the soon to be made spinoff, even though there are entire episodes dedicated on how spongebob meets certain cast members. Continuity has never been a strong suit to the show but downright ignoring all character history is a disgrace.\n\nThe movie has some moments that you can enjoy. With my mind on the whole &apos;camp coral&apos; it did make me laugh less than the average watcher. There isn&apos;t enough scenes that are downright funny. And lastly this didn&apos;t feel like an actual spongebob movie. This comes closer to a movie like Trolls than Spongebob with how many celebrities they actively show, the songs they sing and the story they tell. They chose popculture over entertainment.",
