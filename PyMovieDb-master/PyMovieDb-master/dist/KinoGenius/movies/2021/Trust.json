    "reviewBody": "My issue is with how the &apos;crime&apos; is framed - the words &apos;assault&apos; and &apos;rape&apos; are tossed about liberally. What is never mentioned is &apos;seduction&apos;, the enticement of naive young women /girls by appealing to their romantic fantasies, which has a long social and literary history. The need to feel &apos;loved&apos; and &apos;special&apos;. No violence is ever used. A plot point unnoticed or unmentioned by any of the posters is the father&apos;s profession. Advertising. Marketing stuff to &apos;tweens&apos; using highly sexualized images. Tweens are children between the ages of 9 or 10 and 13. They&apos;re fed a constant diet of the ways to be &apos;desirable&apos; and &apos;sexy, usually by buying stuff to make them look older and more sexually available . How can parents overcome this barrage of noxious merchandising - especially if that&apos;s what provides their good upper middle class life. It also provide the psychological conditions, along with the anonymity of the Internet, for the seduction of very young girls. Charlie is an utter creep, but he&apos;s aided and abetted by an economic order that will do anything to find new &apos;markets&apos;.",
