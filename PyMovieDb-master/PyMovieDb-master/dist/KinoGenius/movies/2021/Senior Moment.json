    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s like one of those later late great Burt Reynold&apos;$ films he did with another great Charles Durning... The film is set in a beautiful place that just fills you with happiness. Shatner may have a gut but he hasn&apos;t aged a bit since 1994... Nearing 91 and he doesn&apos;t look to be slowing down. His body language and mannerism isn&apos;t that of a geriatric man. I just can&apos;t believe the way he moves, and communicate is 90.",
