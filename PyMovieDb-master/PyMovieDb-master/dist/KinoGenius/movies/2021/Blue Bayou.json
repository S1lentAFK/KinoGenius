    "reviewBody": "Justin Chon did a great job with this one. It&apos;s not often you get a director/writer/lead actor in a movie but he did all of those and it was all very well done. The story is poignant, quite incredible that something like this is even possible in real life, but it is sadly the reality, and that in a country that wants to be the example for the rest of the world. To be honest I found this incredibly sad, and that in the land of the free, in the land of opportunities. Justin Chon is not only a good writer but he was also very convincing in his role as the American-Korean. The rest of the cast were also very good playing their respective characters, especially the young Sydney Kowalske. She played very natural, almost like she wasn&apos;t acting, and that&apos;s not given to a lot of child actors. Blue Bayou isn&apos;t a movie that will leave you with a smile, and that&apos;s good, because these kind of stories are still happening now, and a smile would just be wrong when you think about all the lives that have been destroyed.",
