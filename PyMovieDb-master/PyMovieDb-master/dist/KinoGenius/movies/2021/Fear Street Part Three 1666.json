    "reviewBody": "The third and final installment, here we get to learn how and why Sarah Fier came to be.\n\nIt&apos;s a pretty good film, good to see members of the cast mixed up, and given something better to do. Better than the first, perhaps not as good as the second. It&apos;s a worthy conclusion, and gives us lots of answers.\n\nSome great production values here, great buildings, and some fantastic costumes.\n\nOne gripe I have here, the shocking accents, it was hard to tell if they were trying to be Irish, Canadian or something a little more obscure.\n\nPerhaps the single best scene of the three movies comes here, the moment of terror inside the church with The Pastor, it was incredibly macabre and unnerving, it certainly did shock.\n\nEnjoyed it, 7/10.",
