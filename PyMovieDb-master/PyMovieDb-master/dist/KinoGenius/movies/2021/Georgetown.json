    "reviewBody": "Or is it psychopath? I get the 2 mixed up despite the fact I lived next door to one for far too long.\n\nThis is a great (true) story - scary story. Cannot imagine being the daughter, seeing the ruse so clearly and not having my mother believe me.\n\nI would not be surprised if this showed up on Dirty John Series. Sadly, it&apos;s perfect for that franchise.\n\nOkay - the cinematography is a bit off a lot of the time, but that&apos;s forgivable for this first time director. Do hope he doesn&apos;t allow it to happen again. Really hope it wasn&apos;t his choice to shoot it that faded out!\n\nGreat cast! And story. Glad they wrapped it up at the end for us.\n\nIf you want a lesson on what to look for in someone who seems too good to be true - watch this. And if you know someone like him - RUN !!",
