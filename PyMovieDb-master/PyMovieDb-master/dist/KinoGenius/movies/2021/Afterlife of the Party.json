    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s Cassie&apos;s birthday but Lisa manages to make it all about herself. I can tell the writers tried to make it seem like Lisa is the victim of the story, but it&apos;s really Cassie who gets crucified for wanting to have fun on her own birthday. The acting is decent, the set design and costumes are very lively and colorful, and I&apos;m always happy to see Victoria Justice on-screen but the writing needs a lot of work.",
