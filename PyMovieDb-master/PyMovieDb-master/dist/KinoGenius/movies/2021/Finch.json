    "reviewBody": "A sweet little film, especially considering it&apos;s set in a post-apocalyptic hellscape. Maybe that&apos;s the Tom Hanks effect. Comparisons to Cast Away are inevitable, with Wilson the volleyball replaced by Goodyear the dog and Jeff the robot, but the grim sense of the struggle to survive somehow seems muted here. This is light entertainment, geared more towards families or younger viewers. There were cute moments as the robot needs to be trained and weepy moments as the human&apos;s health is failing, but unfortunately it never seemed terribly clever or original. Hanks is great as always and the robot is awkwardly cool, but I wish the story had been better.",
