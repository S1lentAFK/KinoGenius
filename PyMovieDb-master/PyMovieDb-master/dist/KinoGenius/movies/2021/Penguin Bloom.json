    "reviewBody": "An enjoyable little film based on a true story, don&apos;t know what the bad reviewers were expecting? It&apos;s not an action film, just a heartwarming little story of how a rescued magpie helps a family come to terms with the devastating accident suffered by the Mother, and in turn helps her to begin enjoying life again. If nothing else does, the magpies will entertain you, Naomi Watts is her usual reliable self, with a perfectly competent supporting cast. Goes along at a casual pace which puts you in there with the family. I liked it, as has everyone I know who&apos;s seen it!",
