    "reviewBody": "Probably the worst plot and dialog I&apos;ve seen in the past decade. Any episode of T. J. Hooker is far better than this tripe- and mercifully shorter.\n\nAs the algorithm requires 150 characters I will list things I would rather do than watch this movie again: 1) a root canal without anesthesia, 2) clean out porta-johns, 3) invest in a pyramid scheme, 4) soak in a tub of ice water for an hour.",
