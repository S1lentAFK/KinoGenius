    "reviewBody": "No amount of behind-the-scenes cinematic team-ups in recent years can compare to the overwhelming power that the guys behind Gravity Falls (Michael Rianda and Jeff Rowe) and Spider-Verse (Phil Lord and Chris Miller) have when you put their creative minds together on a singular project.\n\nThis is an amazingly fun movie from start to finish, benefited by some brilliantly stylized CGI that continues the trend that Spider-Verse started but taken a few steps further with some added medium blending that very much blew my mind. It also helps that 92% of the jokes land right on target. Did I mention that it also has a disarmingly astute emotional core?\n\nHonestly, at this rate Sony Pictures Animation may be beating Disney and Pixar at their own game.",
