    "reviewBody": "This is cinematic patience, a bare and beautifully drawn out experience that paces and feels exactly like the lives and experiences it portrays. The landscapes are stunning, the camerawork intimate and always thoughtful with its choices. The movie makes subtle, deliberate gestures, and it all culminates into something really special. Movies so plot-thin always must walk the careful border of disinterest - but honestly I could&apos;ve watched another hour of this stuff and never get bored. It&apos;s hypnotizing in its own unique way, and I haven&apos;t really seen anything quite like it. (This is the vibe I wish Sean Penn&apos;s Into the Wild could&apos;ve captured).\n\n8.5/10",
