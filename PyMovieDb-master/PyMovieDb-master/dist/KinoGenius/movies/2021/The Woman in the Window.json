    "reviewBody": "First... Ignore low reviews from people who read the book. This is a movie! I hate it when people expect a film, lasting under 2 hours, to be similar to the book. Probably 0.001 percent of viewers have or will read the book. It&apos;s a film to review. So here goes, it&apos;s entertaining. Original, under a genre of Hitchcock. Great acting and clever camera work. Enjoy it. Just don&apos;t expect it to be exactly like the book and you&apos;ll be entertained. Those reviewers remind me of annoying reviews about a product , giving it one star, and only write about a late delivery! It helps no one.",
