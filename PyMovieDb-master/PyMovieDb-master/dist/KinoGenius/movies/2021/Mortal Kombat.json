    "reviewBody": "Great action and fight choreography as was to be expected from a movie with this title, special effects regarding characters and their abilities were also very well done especially considering the budget constraints this movie had. Storyline was predictable from the beginning and the writing itself isn&apos;t gonna win any awards, characters say their catchphrases from the games in key moments of the film, however, one big surprise for me was the character of Kano. He was the biggest and funniest comic relief character in the whole movie, constantly throwing jokes and insults at other characters. Probably one of the funniest, self aware movie characters I&apos;ve seen in a long time.\n\nThere are also weird editing jumps in the movie, one moment you&apos;re looking at characters interacting and in the next you&apos;re looking at something completely different. The movie suffers from a few of these, but given this is the directors first foray into the world of movie making, I&apos;ll take that L, most of the other important things were handled with care,\n\nIf you know what you&apos;re getting and your expectations are right, this movie isn&apos;t gonna let you down with violence and gore, if you&apos;re expecting more then it&apos;s gonna be a letdown.",
