    "reviewBody": "First off the acting in this film is pretty damn good. Clarke really tricks you into believing she&apos;s from the hollers of east Kentucky. As a Kentuckian myself I give her a 10/10. It just drags in the middle to a speed that a great cast and character drama just can&apos;t pull it out of. I think the filmmakers tried to stay faithful to the actual events, which is respectable to the ones involved, but ultimately it could be told in 30 minutes. Would watch again in a few years for maybe a better perspective on a slow night. Go into it just to watch Clarke and Knoxville play hillbilly pill heads and you shouldn&apos;t be disappointed.",
