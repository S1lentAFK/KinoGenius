There's a darker atmosphere this time around and more characters are introduced including Gilderoy Lockhart (hilariously played by Kenneth Branagh), Draco Malfoy's father, Lucius (a great performance by Jason Isaacs, exactly how I imagined the character from the books!), Ron's father, Arthur, and the mysterious Dobby the house elf (fortunately he isn't anywhere near as annoying as other CG characters in other movies, but I won't name any names... *cough*JarJarBinks*cough*)\\n\\nThe movie sticks closely to the novel, but as in the last movie we miss some of those scenes where we start to learn a little more about the characters, especially the hate-hate relationship between Harry and Professor Snape (who was seriously underused in this movie!)\\n\\nAll in all it's definitely worth checking out, the running time of 160 minutes may seem a little long but it doesn't seem that long when you're watching it. By the way, whatever you do DO NOT leave until the credits have ended, otherwise you'll miss a little extra treat...", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 686283, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.4}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Adventure", "Family", "Fantasy"], "datePublished": "2002-11-15", "keywords": "invisibility cloak,wizard,sequel,witch,boarding school", "duration": "PT2H41M", "actor": [{"name": "Daniel Radcliffe", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0705356/"}, {"name": "Rupert Grint", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0342488/"}, {"name": "Emma Watson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0914612/"}], "director": [{"name": "Chris Columbus", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001060/"}], "creator": [{"name": "J.K.
