Its not even a very good movie. But it is a bit of a guilty pleasure. Kind of half vampire movie, half rock video.\\n\\nThe reason I like Queen of the Damned? Stuart Townsend as Lestat - he is utterly beautiful in this film. Sexy, seductive, with model-looks. The man looks the part and he plays the part very well too. You can understand why characters are seduced by him. He totally oozes that kind of sexy rockstar charm.\\n\\nI know the movie is literally nothing like the novel, and it garnered a LOT of criticism for that, as well as it generally not being a particularly great movie even if you treat it as stand-alone.\\n\\nI tend to put this movie on when I fancy watching something a little silly that doesn't require an awful lot of thinking about. Its kind of early 2000s trash at its finest.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 59591, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.2}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Drama", "Fantasy", "Horror"], "datePublished": "2002-04-12", "keywords": "vampire,rock star,world domination,brutality,bar", "duration": "PT1H41M", "actor": [{"name": "Aaliyah", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004691/"}, {"name": "Stuart Townsend", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0870204/"}, {"name": "Marguerite Moreau", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0603413/"}], "director": [{"name": "Michael Rymer", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753382/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Anne Rice", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0723351/"}, {"name": "Scott Abbott", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0008053/"}, {"name": "Michael Petroni", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0678104/"}]}
