It is a very good movie with charm, humor, sadness and most of all, genial acting! Reese Witherspoon and Josh Lucas are the two characters that you can relate to. Especially the dog part is very fun. I think what makes this movie good is that it is a story you can relate to, but made with humor. Yet there are a part sadness in the story.\n\nIt begins with that Melanie is asked by the son of the mayor if she wants to marry him. Then she says yes, but she has things to make up and decides to go down to her hometown in Alabama to get a divorce from her husband who she hasn't met for years, not after she lost her child and he was drunk on their wedding.\n\nThe concept and plot is very smart, when the tone is told with humour even in situations that are serious. In fact, if the movie hadn't humor, it had been falling apart. The humor is lifting the story to a little more than just good. It is so fun, so full of genial and amusing characters, excellent acting and an excellent ending. Maybe a movie that mostly girls like to watch, but anyway a good movie.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "actor": [{"name": "Reese Witherspoon", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000702/"}, {"name": "Patrick Dempsey", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001131/"}, {"name": "Josh Lucas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524197/"}], "director": [{"name": "Andy Tennant", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0855035/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Douglas J.
