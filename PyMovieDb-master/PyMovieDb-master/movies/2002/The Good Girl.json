My original copy was actually on VHS, so had to wait to find a DVD. I like this movie from the start to the finish. Great characters all the way through which for me is the best part of the movie. Great acting as well. You can actually feel Justine&apos;s (Jennifer Aniston) pain at being stuck in a small town with a lousy job and the feeling that life is going nowhere. Lots of quirky turns in this film as well as the story goes along. Fun story with a lot o reality to it. I think it&apos;s one of Jennifer&apos;s best, but then I pretty much like everything she&apos;s in. Great actress.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 47069, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.4}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Drama", "Romance"], "datePublished": "2003-01-10", "keywords": "dysfunctional marriage,small town,reference to holden caulfield,mental illness,husband wife relationship", "duration": "PT1H33M", "actor": [{"name": "Jennifer Aniston", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000098/"}, {"name": "Jake Gyllenhaal", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0350453/"}, {"name": "Deborah Rush", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0750658/"}], "director": [{"name": "Miguel Arteta", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0037708/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Mike White", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0925234/"}]}
