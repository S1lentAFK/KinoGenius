They have jumped from the small screen to the big screen, and the transfer is incredible. The high-quality computer animation that is used for each Veggie Tales video has been upgraded and enlarged and introduces us to the most talented singing and dancing vegetables around.\n\nIt's all there, from the vivid colors that make our characters look so delicious, to the humor that tickles our funny bones.\n\nOne of the most action-packed stories from the bible is now one of the funniest and most entertaining Sunday morning lesson to hit the big screen. A very bold and clear message about mercy and compassion make up this wild and adventurous tale that speaks not only to the tiny vegetable fans in the audience, but to the parents as well.\n\nLike a refreshing fresh bowl of tossed salad that is low-fat but rich in flavor, this film screams for a second helping.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "actor": [{"name": "Phil Vischer", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1008415/"}, {"name": "Mike Nawrocki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1007740/"}, {"name": "Tim Hodge", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388113/"}], "director": [{"name": "Phil Vischer", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1008415/"}, {"name": "Mike Nawrocki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1007740/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Phil Vischer", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1008415/"}, {"name": "Mike Nawrocki", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1007740/"}, {"name": "Tim Hodge", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0388113/"}]}
