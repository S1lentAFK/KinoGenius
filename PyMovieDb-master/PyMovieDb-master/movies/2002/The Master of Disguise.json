I don't know what most of the voters were expecting, it was obviously a family movie, and I appreciated that. There was no graphic violence, just some slapping, nor were there any sex references, nor any inappropriate jokes (the flatulence jokes were a bit overdone). \n\nThe movie was humorous, nothing gut busting, but it had enough funny parts to keep me smiling or chuckling the whole time. There were no real lulls or low points, just a nice even keel.\n\nThis movie is middle of the road. I give it a 5 out of 10.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 5}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 27087, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 3.3}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Adventure", "Comedy", "Family"], "datePublished": "2003-01-17", "keywords": "slapstick comedy,italian american,father son relationship,investigation,running gag", "duration": "PT1H20M", "actor": [{"name": "Dana Carvey", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001022/"}, {"name": "Jennifer Esposito", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0261170/"}, {"name": "Harold Gould", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332390/"}], "director": [{"name": "Perry Andelin Blake", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0086690/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Dana Carvey", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001022/"}, {"name": "Harris Goldberg", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0325214/"}]}
