The film shows this situation up very well, The acting was first rate and the film in the end is a very worthy effort. Denzil Washington does a fine job of showing how we all would feel if we were thrust into a nightmare situation that meant you could loose your child simply because you don't have enough money to pay the rip of prices of the blood sucking health system.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 142823, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.1}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "datePublished": "2002-04-26", "keywords": "hospital,insurance,hostage,heart transplant,universal health care", "duration": "PT1H56M", "actor": [{"name": "Denzel Washington", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243/"}, {"name": "Robert Duvall", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000380/"}, {"name": "Gabriela Oltean", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1131193/"}], "director": [{"name": "Nick Cassavetes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001024/"}], "creator": [{"name": "James Kearns", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444006/"}]}
