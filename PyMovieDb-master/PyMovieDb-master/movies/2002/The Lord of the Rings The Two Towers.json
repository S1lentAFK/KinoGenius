After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I&apos;ve never been before.\n\nThis is cinema at its very best.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 1766876, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 8.8}, "contentRating": "12A", "genre": ["Action", "Adventure", "Drama"], "datePublished": "2002-12-18", "keywords": "middle earth,wizard,hobbit,orc,mission", "duration": "PT2H59M", "actor": [{"name": "Elijah Wood", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000704/"}, {"name": "Ian McKellen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005212/"}, {"name": "Viggo Mortensen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001557/"}], "director": [{"name": "Peter Jackson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001392/"}], "creator": [{"name": "J.R.R.
