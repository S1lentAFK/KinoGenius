This is the worst excuse for an adaptation of a novel I have ever seen. Nothing is explained about Siddalee, Shep, Vivi, the Ya-Yas, the younger siblings, Buggy, etc. No one will understand fully the anguish that the children went through as children or the anguish that Vivi went through in her own childhood. Shortcuts were taken left and right in this film, much to the detriment of the storyline. For instance, Shep is not a living saint, Vivi did not simply beat her children because of dexamyl, Teensy's mother is barely mentioned, Vivi's stay at the boarding school was left out, and where is Aunt Jezie, grownup Lulu, Little Shep, and Baylor? I realize that it was a two hour film, but an adaptation should never have been attempted if it wasn't going to be done faithfully. Everything in this film was explained away too easily. Sidda needed much more than a sob story about her mother's loss and use of dexamyl to explain her behavior. Too easy, too simple, too cheesy. No one could possibly come away with a clear understanding and resolution of the plot. \\n\\nMy recommendation: SKIP IT and read the fabulous books this was supposedly based on: Little Altars Everywhere and The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya sisterhood.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "actor": [{"name": "Sandra Bullock", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113/"}, {"name": "Ellen Burstyn", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000995/"}, {"name": "Fionnula Flanagan", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001217/"}], "director": [{"name": "Callie Khouri", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451884/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Rebecca Wells", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0920385/"}, {"name": "Mark Andrus", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0029125/"}, {"name": "Callie Khouri", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451884/"}]}
