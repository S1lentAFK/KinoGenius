Turns out, when one is near Solaris, one tends to see dead people--or duplicates thereof. In Kelvin's case, this would be a doppelganger of his deceased wife, Rheya (McElhone), which seems to have Rheya's personality traits and memories.\\n\\nI had heard that Solaris was excruciatingly slow and, consequently, unbearably boring, but I didn't quite agree. I understood that many shots were included or extended to set the mood, and to illustrate thought and memory, and it was all visually interesting. I could see, for example, where Soderbergh showed his love for Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with lingering shots of Clooney in an astronaut's helmet, patterns of light reflected on its glass. However I would have traded the extra hour of atmospherics for a deeper exploration of the intriguing questions the premise raised. When we say we love someone, are we saying we love the sum of the person's characteristics? Were we to lose our loved one, would a twin with the same likes, dislikes, and quirks be a suitable replacement? Would you want to live on in the memories of your friends and family or, as Woody Allen prefers, to live on in your apartment? This film seems less interested in delving into these mysteries than it is in portraying grief and subjective memory. Valid objectives, but Solaris left me wanting to see an episode of the similarly themed Caprica (of which I've only seen the pilot movie).\\n\\nWhy you should see it You never got over that crush you developed on Clooney during his tenure on ER. You're in the mood for a visual poem of love and loss. You enjoy any movie set in outer space. You're the founder of Jeremy Davies/Dr. Faraday Fan Club.\\n\\nWhy you should avoid it Star Trek: The Next Generation was set in outer space too. Pick an episode and it will lead you through a debate of life's big questions, in half the time.\\n\\n--from my review at www.1man365movies.com", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 85926, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.2}, "contentRating": "12A", "genre": ["Drama", "Mystery", "Romance"], "datePublished": "2003-02-28", "keywords": "space station,space,planet,trapped in space,title at the end", "duration": "PT1H39M", "actor": [{"name": "George Clooney", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/"}, {"name": "Natascha McElhone", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001523/"}, {"name": "Ulrich Tukur", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0876300/"}], "director": [{"name": "Steven Soderbergh", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Stanislaw Lem", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0501015/"}, {"name": "Steven Soderbergh", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001752/"}]}
