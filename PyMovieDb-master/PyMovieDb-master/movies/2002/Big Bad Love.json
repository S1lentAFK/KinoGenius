All the players -- Arliss Howard, Debra Winger, the underrated Paul Le Mat, Rosanna Arquette, and Angie Dickinson -- are excellent. Instead of spoonfeeding us, the movie lets us discover the characters&apos; past lives and motivations. It contains grand images: someone&apos;s novel scattered in a giant patch of kudzu; a painting in progress on the side of a rusted railroad car. Some people will like it just for the music, including by Tom Waits.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "actor": [{"name": "Arliss Howard", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397124/"}, {"name": "Debra Winger", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000700/"}, {"name": "Paul Le Mat", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0494432/"}], "director": [{"name": "Arliss Howard", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397124/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Larry Brown", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0114051/"}, {"name": "Jim Howard", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397389/"}, {"name": "Arliss Howard", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0397124/"}]}
