One of the few films made by Roger Avery, 1/2 of the creative genius behind Pulp Fiction. You&apos;d expect this to be a marriage of the two. It has a tremendous amount in common with A Clockwork Orange in terms of editing and character development. Also, if the psychotic nature of the main character Sean gave you flashbacks to American Psycho, that&apos;s because he actually is supposed to be Patrick Bateman&apos;s younger brother. This is a film about sex that is empty, cynical and depraved. However, with BEE, you get what you signed up for. Go for the ride, if you can handle it.\\n\\nSidenote: The Rules of Attraction contains the best vacation montage ever in a movie.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 53150, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}}
