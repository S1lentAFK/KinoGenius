Jennifer for a start gives it a green light in my book, and yes, while its is reminiscent of Sleeping with the Enemy, I find Slim much stronger than Julias character in that movie.... Michael APted is a brilliant director, and Juliette Lewis makes up the rest of a great cast. I was shocked when it went strauight to DVD in the UK, i saw a pirate copy from a friend who wokrs at Columbia, and I loved it , and raved about it for weeks...\\n\\nIt keeps me on the edge of my seat , and everytime I watch it, that first time Mitch hits Slim still makes me gasp. I whole heartedly recommend this film top anyone...", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 47367, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.8}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Crime", "Drama", "Thriller"], "datePublished": "2002-11-29", "keywords": "domestic violence,abusive husband,psychopath,adulterous husband,home invasion", "duration": "PT1H55M", "actor": [{"name": "Jennifer Lopez", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000182/"}, {"name": "Billy Campbell", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001004/"}, {"name": "Tessa Allen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0021100/"}], "director": [{"name": "Michael Apted", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000776/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Nicholas Kazan", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443582/"}]}
