Then Spirit is probably not the movie for you, it is instead one of the nicest animated features to come along in a long time to not have Disney written all over it. No, the horses do not talk and they shouldn&apos;t as the whole story is told from a horse&apos;s point of voice in a wonderful narrative. In fact there&apos;s not a lot of pointless dialog to weigh down the movie at all.\\n\\nInstead it&apos;s filled by a wonderful score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Bryan Adams who admittedly I wasn&apos;t a big fan off except for (Everything I Do (I Do It For You) and Star) but the songs he did for this movie especially Here I Am, Get Off Of My Back, Can&apos;t Take Me, Brothers Under The Sun and Sound The Bugle made me download the soundtrack from Walmart.com the next day.\\n\\nThe main reasons I liked this move would have to be the beautiful drawn animation, mixed with an endearing story with some comedy elements and a wonderful soundtrack. Spirit is simply fun and enjoyable for the whole family no matter what their age.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "actor": [{"name": "Matt Damon", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000354/"}, {"name": "James Cromwell", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000342/"}, {"name": "Daniel Studi", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836070/"}], "director": [{"name": "Kelly Asbury", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0038432/"}, {"name": "Lorna Cook", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0177170/"}], "creator": [{"name": "John Fusco", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0299301/"}]}
