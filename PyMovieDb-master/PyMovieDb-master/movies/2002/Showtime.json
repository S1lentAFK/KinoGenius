Murphy and De Niro are great together!", "reviewBody": "Absolutely entertaining. That is all I can say about this movie. This is one of the first movies in years that I can say I did not want to shut off halfway through. Murphy is great, it's good to see him in this kind of role again, and De Niro is fantastic as always. Showtime is about a cop, Mitch Preston (DeNiro), who after a huge screwup, is forced by his department to do a reality cop show. Preston is teamed up with Trey Sellars (Murphy), a cop who wants to be an actor, and the fun begins! Rene Russo is also in this film, and she is beautiful as always. There are some extremely funny moments, as well as some great stunt scenes. Let's hope that Eddie Murphy keeps this kind of role up, as I miss his Beverly Hills Cop days. Definately the best cop buddy movie since probably Lethal Weapon. If you are a fan of the Lethal Weapon series, you will definately love this one.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 64992, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 5.5}, "contentRating": "12", "genre": ["Action", "Comedy", "Crime"], "datePublished": "2002-05-03", "keywords": "police,buddy cop,police shootout,foot chase,brawl", "duration": "PT1H35M", "actor": [{"name": "Robert De Niro", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/"}, {"name": "Eddie Murphy", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000552/"}, {"name": "Rene Russo", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000623/"}], "director": [{"name": "Tom Dey", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0223359/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Jorge Saralegui", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0764822/"}, {"name": "Keith Sharon", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0972440/"}, {"name": "Alfred Gough", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332184/"}]}
