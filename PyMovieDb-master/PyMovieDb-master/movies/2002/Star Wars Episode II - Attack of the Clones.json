Senator Padm\\u00e9 Amidala (Natalie Portman) arrives at Coruscant to vote on the creation of the Army of the Republic. After an assassination attempt, Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is assigned to protect Padm\\u00e9. They haven&apos;t seen each other in 10 years. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) traces the attacks to bounty hunter Jango Fett and the hidden water planet Kamino.\\n\\nThis dialog is horribly flat. It&apos;s not simply the stilted awkward romance. The expositions are all done in tired uninteresting way. There is a lot of walking-and-talking and sitting in a circle. It is all terrible and I would suggest fast-forwarding several sections of the movie.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the CGI continues to be great. The best is Kamino. That world is sci-fi heaven. I love the aliens. I love Jango Fett and Anakin is nowhere to be found. McGregor gets to leave behind that dead weight. I also like the Blade-Runner-like lower levels of Coruscant although that bar should have been a lot seedier. It has too much of a sports bar feel. The coliseum is good and who doesn&apos;t love that outfit on Portman. There is plenty of fun action in this movie but it needs a better writer to punch up the dialog.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 6}}, "actor": [{"name": "Hayden Christensen", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0159789/"}, {"name": "Natalie Portman", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204/"}, {"name": "Ewan McGregor", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/"}], "director": [{"name": "George Lucas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000184/"}], "creator": [{"name": "George Lucas", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000184/"}, {"name": "Jonathan Hales", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355054/"}]}
