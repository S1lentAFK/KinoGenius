Not a bad soundtrack either (Fat Boy Slim, Moby, 3rd Strike)\n\nBeware though it will only be shown on big screen cinemas only. I believe there to be only nine in the UK.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 294, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.6}, "contentRating": "PG", "genre": ["Documentary", "Sport"], "datePublished": "2002-06-28", "keywords": "extreme sport,motorsports sport,skateboard,motocross,skateboarding", "duration": "PT47M", "actor": [{"name": "Bob Burnquist", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992389/"}, {"name": "Brian Deegan", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1146662/"}, {"name": "Tony Hawk", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005000/"}], "director": [{"name": "Bruce Hendricks", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376712/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Bruce Hendricks", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0376712/"}]}
