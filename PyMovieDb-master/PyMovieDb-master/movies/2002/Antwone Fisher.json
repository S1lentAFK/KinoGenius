This story tells of a nightmare existence that leaves terrible scars but suggests the triumph of the human spirit in the end.\\n\\nWe can nit pick on some first effort problems with too many close ups and not the best of editing these scenes but the simplicity of other scenes that project such power cannot be understated.\\n\\nIf the academy overlooks this film it will be travesty. This film pulls no punches and goes to the cold hard facts of the story with a purity that usually doesn't transcend from a novel to the screen. This , of course , is a tribute to the Director.\\n\\nThis is a dandy so go see it and tell your friends to go see it too!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 38203, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 7.3}}
