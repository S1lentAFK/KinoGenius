I don&apos;t know if mister person who made that negative comment on the movie even knows what a street gang is living in Alabama, but a lot of people who grew up in or around N.Y.C. know what I mean. I don&apos;t want to make any real comments on the movie in case you did&apos;t see it as of yet, but this I can say if it&apos;s street gang movies that interest you with some truth behind it you should see this movie.
