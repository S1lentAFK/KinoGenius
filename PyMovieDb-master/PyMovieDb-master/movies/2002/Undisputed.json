Hard-hitting yet formulaic boxing-in-prison flick with professional pugilist and heavyweight world champ Rhames facing off with the maximum security&apos;s current in-stir (and undefeated) competitor Snipes (both in amazing physical shape and displaying enough testosterone for two flicks). Falk, at his crustiest, is a scene-stealing hoot as the aged Mafioso con that sets up the grudge match and gets the grease to the wheel. Filmmaker Walter Hill (who co-wrote the lean, mean screenplay with frequent collaborator David Giler ) proves to be a formidable genre helmsman but offers the viewer wanting more.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": null, "bestRating": null, "ratingValue": null}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 34209, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.1}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Action", "Crime", "Drama"], "datePublished": "2002-08-23", "keywords": "boxing sport,combat sport,martial arts action,prison,boxing", "duration": "PT1H36M", "actor": [{"name": "Wesley Snipes", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000648/"}, {"name": "Ving Rhames", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000609/"}, {"name": "Peter Falk", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000393/"}], "director": [{"name": "Walter Hill", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001353/"}], "creator": [{"name": "David Giler", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0318429/"}, {"name": "Walter Hill", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001353/"}]}
