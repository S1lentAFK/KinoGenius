Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck are tremendous in their respective roles as Doyle and Gavin. They star in what is a gripping premise, as the two characters involved constantly try to one up each other.\n\nIt's a fairly simple concept, but the film portrays it nicely. There are a few moments where things could be worked out instantly but aren't, which is questionable no doubt though you can say that about most films in truth.\n\nHighly recommend. Terrific leads, perfect pacing and an engaging plot.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 9}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 74202, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.5}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "datePublished": "2002-11-01", "keywords": "road rage,lawyer,feud,revenge,car accident", "duration": "PT1H38M", "actor": [{"name": "Ben Affleck", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000255/"}, {"name": "Samuel L.
