It has fallen pray to mismarketing like so many good films before. Farrell is good (he'll be BIG soon, mark my words), Marcel Iures fills the screen with his presence and performance. Willis however, I must admit, play Willis. But hey; I like him for what he is.\nThe plot is well thought out, intelligently blending the lines between the war- and the courtroom genre. Don't tell me you anticipated every twist in the plot.\n\nFor all it's worth; the movie was very different in a great way from all war movies in last couple of years. Different in quite a smart way, too.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 55053, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.3}, "contentRating": "15", "genre": ["Drama", "War"], "datePublished": "2002-05-24", "keywords": "n word,f word,battle of the bulge,bulge,prison drama", "duration": "PT2H5M", "actor": [{"name": "Bruce Willis", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/"}, {"name": "Colin Farrell", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0268199/"}, {"name": "Terrence Howard", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005024/"}], "director": [{"name": "Gregory Hoblit", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387706/"}], "creator": [{"name": "John Katzenbach", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0441896/"}, {"name": "Billy Ray", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0712753/"}, {"name": "Terry George", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0313623/"}]}
