Colin Hanks and Jack Black do well in their respective roles, pretty much straightlaced Hanks reacting in shock to his brother Black&apos;s drug-induced pandemonium. Hanks loves his brother who tries his best to help him out, as high as he is. This caring carries the story, and pretty much makes us forgive many of the plot holes and missed backgrounding and other types of story lacks. The actors make Orange County warm and funny and likable, and they all have a believable chemistry too. In lesser hands Orange County wouldve been underwhelming because of how fragmented important parts of the story are, but the cast saves it. Nevertheless Orange County has memorable moments and a good soundtrack (being an MTV production) and a genuine depth in terms of what emotions the actors manage to get across rather than what they actually get to say or do. Decent!", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 7}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 51787, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 6.2}}
