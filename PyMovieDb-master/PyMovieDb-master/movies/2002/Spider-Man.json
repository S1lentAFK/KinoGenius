How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It&apos;s richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :\\n\\nTHE ARTWORK.\\n\\nThis films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.\\n\\nIf this doesn&apos;t win the Oscar for best animated feature I&apos;m rioting, and you&apos;d better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 10}}, "rating": {"ratingCount": 347708, "bestRating": 10, "worstRating": 1, "ratingValue": 8.6}}
