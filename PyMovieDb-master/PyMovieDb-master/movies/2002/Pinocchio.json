The new Pinocchio story has the facade of a children's fable, as you would expect, but as soon as events allow it, it becomes a dark and profound film, dealing with themes of obedience, death and sacrifice.\n\nThe character design, sets and models are wonderful. The care for small visual, kinetic and narrative details is impressive. Despite being Guillermo del Toro's first foray into animation, stop motion fits him like a glove.\n\nThis is one of those movies you don't expect to see in 2022 unless you're a fan of Wes Anderson, Henry Selick, or Tim Burton. It's definitely part of the best of the year, for its execution more than for its story.\n\nFully recommended for all audiences.", "reviewRating": {"worstRating": 1, "bestRating": 10, "ratingValue": 8}}, "director": [{"name": "Guillermo del Toro", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/"}, {"name": "Mark Gustafson", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0348993/"}], "actor": [{"name": "Ewan McGregor", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000191/"}, {"name": "David Bradley", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0103195/"}, {"name": "Gregory Mann", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9640481/"}], "creator": [{"name": "Guillermo del Toro", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/"}, {"name": "Patrick McHale", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3239034/"}, {"name": "Carlo Collodi", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0172830/"}]}
