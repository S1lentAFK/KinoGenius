    "reviewBody": "In a fantastic adaptation of this period classic the only major disappointment was the poor use of hair extensions when Yaichachi grew old. A fellow enthusiast, Jessica Maltby, wept on several occasions during the film, and i myself must confess that i shed a tear in a particularly moving part of the screenplay where a young Nick is told off by his mother. The finest performance in my opinion was that of Pocatello&apos;s horse, who was inspirational in the part as Pocatello&apos;s horse. Some of the action scenes are also well worth a look, especially the fight scene with another Indian tribe, where realistic punches are thrown with breathtaking accuracy.",
