    "reviewBody": "His film is very well done, the performances are great, the direction is great, and overall it&apos;s an excellent look at the effects of PTSD and the life that these guys come home to after fighting a useless and futile war. I call it the Cheney after effect because these guys went into a war without having any idea what they were coming back to, and they came back to a VA that completely betrayed them, because the budget was never there to take care of these guys after they devoted their hearts and souls to fighting for their nation. It&apos;s a real indictment of the VA but it&apos;s absolutely true from everything I&apos;m told.\n\nThis is a very powerful film that just tugs at your heart. Not what I would call entertainment, but a great movie. Cheney, Bush Jr., Rumsfeld, and Wolfowitz should have been tried at the Hague.",
