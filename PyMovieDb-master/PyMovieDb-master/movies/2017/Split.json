    "reviewBody": "For a serious horror movie, look elsewhere. For a b-movie that&apos;s right up there with Army of Darkness for amusement value and quotable lines, watch Split Second.\n\nStone and Durkin are the Gritty Cop and Sidekick who hunt down a mystery killer who taunts them at every step. It has supernatural strength and speed. They have guns. Big F***ing Guns.\n\nDefinitely worth renting, and buying too if this is the kind of movie you like.",
