    "reviewBody": "Starts off a bit weird/sad then gets to be one of the most joyful and inspirational pieces of art in film. A very well written and adorable story, even written by the main actor (Kyle Mooney) James Pope, about how he's basically obsessed with Brigsby Bear and wants to make a movie about it, which is lovely. Purely delightful cult almost family flick! Also this is my 240th review which is awesome!",
