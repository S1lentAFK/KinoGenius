    "reviewBody": "I had a reasonably fun time with Spiderman Homecoming, but I have a few big issues that prevent me from loving it...\n\nFirstly, Peter Parker&apos;s vulnerability/invulnerability. There&apos;s a scene where Spiderman bangs his head on the roof of a truck, knocking himself unconscious, yet later on in the film, a couple of tons of concrete and steel land on the lad&apos;s head with no lasting damage. Not long after, Peter falls to the ground from a crashing jet (presumably travelling at a couple of hundred miles an hour) and gets up without a problem. Concussion one minute, indestructible the next!\n\nSpiderman&apos;s strength is inconsistent too: Peter is holding together two halves of the Staten Island ferry in one scene, but later he is struggling to free himself from some rubble.\n\nI also have a problem with The Avengers&apos; very lax approach to shifting their equipment to new premises: Happy (Jon Favreau) loads all of the Avenger&apos;s weapons/armour onto an unmanned aircraft - not one person to guard it. Of course, this suited the plot, but it was extremely daft. Surely a couple of superheroes could have taken time out from saving the world to escort the precious cargo.\n\nLast moan: did Spidey really need a high-tech suit equipped with AI and special assault modes? I thought Spiderman relied on Spidey sense.\n\nOn a more positive note, I enjoyed Peter&apos;s trials and tribulations at high-school, and thought that the twist revelation about the true identity of Vulture was well handled (I didn&apos;t see it coming). The special effects are, as always, very impressive, and Director Jon Watts handles the action well enough, but Sam Raimi needn&apos;t worry: his first two Spiderman movies remain the best.",
