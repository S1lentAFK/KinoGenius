    "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t remember I last anticipated seeing a film as much as this. No theatrical release to speak of here in the UK, impossible to find on domestic dvd so ended up with a Dutch import. The IMDB score of 4.3 wasn&apos;t encouraging but I was still looking forward to seeing it.\n\nIn the end it was a real pleasure. Not a film you watch for narrative satisfaction but intensely atmospheric and a performance from Kirsten Dunst that kept you engaged from start to finish.\n\nBeautiful to look at, listen to and experience. Well worth your time.",
