    "reviewBody": "Cameron is sent to straight camp after being found kissing her girlfriend in a car. I really wanted to like this movie, but as often happens with gay movies the script didn&apos;t deliver. Cameron is not going to be broken, the head of the institution clearly has no idea what he&apos;s doing, one of the pupils hurts himself... all ideas that should have been developed, but are just delivered flat to the audience. Underwhelming.",
