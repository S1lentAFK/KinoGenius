    "reviewBody": "Is this a masterpiece in the canon of Woody Allen films? No. Is it a solidly entertaining experience that&apos;s worth a couple hours of your time and the price of admission? Absolutely. Kate Winslet, Jim Belushi, and Juno Temple all turn in excellent performances. While Justin Timberlake is hampered by some awkward, stilted dialogue, he has some shining moments as well. The plot is engaging and unpredictable, and the setting and soundtrack are stylish and pure Allen. Yes, the story line has some flaws and derivative elements--and I think the film could have benefited from some more aggressive editing--but it is wholly inaccurate to dismiss it as an abysmal piece of garbage, as so many critics seem eager to do. It&apos;s clear to me that some critics have allowed their distaste for Allen&apos;s personal missteps to color their view of this film, and that&apos;s unfair not only to Allen but also to the rest of the cast and crew, not to mention the public.",
