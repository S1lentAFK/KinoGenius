    "reviewBody": "I'm frankly waiting for other releases and didn't want to re-watch the good ones, and that's how I landed on this. And in all honesty, I watched it for Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Christine Baranski, and Susan Sarandon. With a star-studded cast as such, I was a bit disappointed there weren't many laugh-out-loud moments, it did bring on a smile though. I'm guessing core-moms might enjoy this as it seemed like a mellowed-down cross of Magic Mike XXL - Bad Moms and Daddy's Home.\n\nIt's not great for a Christmas watch but if you have nothing to do and want to watch something new without paying much attention to the screen, it is ideal for background noise and fluff. You will know the story even if you skip major junks. There's nothing new to be offered apart from some good chemistry between the cast. So if you're not going to pick the movie apart and don't care for a feel-good Christmas movie, give this one a shot.",
