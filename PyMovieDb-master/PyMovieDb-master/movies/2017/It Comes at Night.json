    "reviewBody": "Despite the title sounding very sinister, the film is anything but what it implies. Too little information is given about the &apos;disease&apos; and the rest of the world. The absence of CGI is refreshing, though, and makes it that much more realistic. Great character bonding, too.\n\nBut what comes at night? The sick? The sickness? What? Nothing came at night...",
