    "reviewBody": "Just came back from the theater and I&apos;m so conflicted. I don&apos;t know what to say. I really really want to love it but I really don&apos;t like it. The force awakens left so much potential for an amazing movie but this was huge chance missed. Instead I saw a misguided incongruous and incomplete movie that saddens me to my core. The magic is gone, I don&apos;t know what else I can say.",
