    "reviewBody": "Tra la laaaaa!!!!\nThe hit children's book series finally makes it to the big screen (what took them so long?) in all its scatological silliness. The film does a terrific job of capturing the spirit and tone of the books, and there's no sense in rolling your eyes at the potty humor, because that's exactly what Captain Underpants is there to deliver. I saw this with my wife and two sons, and let me just say that my kids weren't the only ones giggling throughout.\nGrade: A-",
