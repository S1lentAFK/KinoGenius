    "reviewBody": "I typically like post-apocalyptic movies and TV shows. I don&apos;t mind the premise of the movie, but nothing about it grabbed my interest, except that it was so bad (and with its cast) that I figured it had to get good at some point. It didn&apos;t. Lack of action and dialogue was bizarre, to say the least. Maybe if they had cut out the little dialogue that there was it could have fallen into a silent movie category and had something. I&apos;m left with a void trying to explain how I feel about it. I suppose that is how I feel about.",
