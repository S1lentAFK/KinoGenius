    "reviewBody": "This is my first movie of this entire series. I don't know if there is any connection with other movies or not but I really get the whole story without watching the previous ones. All I can say, it's a decent movie which can be enjoyed with your whole family. If I talked about story, all horror movies stories are same xD. All horror movies either start with moving into a haunted house which they didn't know :) but eventually get to know or someone has possessed someone.\n\nPersonally, I kind of love this. It was an average type of movie. It has what I usually look for 'Jump scares'.",
