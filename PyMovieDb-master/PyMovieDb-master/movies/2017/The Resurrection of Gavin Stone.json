    "reviewBody": "This is a Christian Propaganda movie and I&apos;m an unbeliever. To be precise I made mine Captain Fantastic&apos;s lines where the children say &apos;We don&apos;t make fun of People  (Pause)  except Christians&apos;.\n\nThis film was however nice. An Indie movie with an inspired plot and good lines. And art is art, no matter who makes it and what his certainties are. What matters is only the result and both Andrea Nasfell (Writer) and Dallas Jenkins (Director) are renowned artists, and all the Cast did well (Brett Dalton in particular).\n\nSo if you&apos;d like to watch, sit down and breathe normally. Even though Christians will Try and Convert you, I&apos;ve already been through it and made it trough the end unchanged. And so will you, I&apos;m sure.",
