    "reviewBody": "I decided to watch &apos;Table 19&apos; because I had already seen all of the major blockbuster movies and it looked like a harmless, little piece of fluff. Once the movie started and the guests were seated, the movie really felt like a wedding reception and it became more interesting. The story seemed like it was going to use the same old wedding-story plot, but they threw in quite a few unexpected twists. I really enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would. It was a nice little surprise.",
