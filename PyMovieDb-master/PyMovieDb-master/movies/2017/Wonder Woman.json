    "reviewBody": "Much better than I would have thought. I&apos;m not a big fan of Wonder Woman, but I can say that this movie is my favorites from DC, but that doesn&apos;t say much considering the past. I really like the period in which the action of the film takes place, during a real war is not something usual for a movie with superheroes. The actors are good, so is the action, maybe act 3 is a bit weak, but it works.",
