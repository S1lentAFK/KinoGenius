    "reviewBody": "(Romance) in the Digital Age is an attractive mix of satire and sentiment about an emo band reunited at a Christmas wedding.after a decade.\n\nIt is filmed in semi-documentary style with a fan videoing the.wedding. Thr acting is naturaliric and quite good in a small movie without big names. LOLO performs the title song movingly without residue of emo angst. Beibg about our digital age, jokes about digital cats, undigital, parents, selfies, and Google information exchange are beside observations on music fans, fave songs, and, of course romance.. The direction and photographyy blend well to counterpont the dialogue and facial expressions that are often out of sync.\n\nI am not young enough or hip enough to know why Romance is in brackets. That is just as well as the movie is probably sending up that type.\n\nYou will not remember this movie forever but it is fun while it lasts.",
