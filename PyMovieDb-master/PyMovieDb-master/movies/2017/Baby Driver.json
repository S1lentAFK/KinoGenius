    "reviewBody": "Baby Driver is one hell of a film,I was lucky enough to go to preview of this film and it was worth it.This film uses music the way no other film has ever, It's stylish and has a cast that bring it to life especially Ansel Elgort,Jamie Foxx,Jon Hamm and Kevin Spacey bring a performance that almost tops all their others.The film has exciting car chases and intense moments that leave you on the edge of your seat just acing to know what happens,the final act is probably where Baby Driver shines in all it's glory.Period. Overall this film is a film for everyone,it has music that makes you want to get up and dance right there in the theater.I give Baby Driver a 10/10,go and see it now.",
