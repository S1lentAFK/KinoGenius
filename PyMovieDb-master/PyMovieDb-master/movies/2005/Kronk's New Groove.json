    "reviewBody": "Being a huge fan of the original movie, The Emperor's New Groove, I was thrilled to find that a sequel had been made. I bought the movie thinking that, at its worst, it would have some familiar characters and a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. However, I was delighted to find that it was as good as it could be without being the original classic.\n\nFor those who weren't fans of the first movie, this may be such a good choice as there are many 'in jokes' and nods to the original. Also the plot is quite complicated for a cartoon, effectively covering three stories in the one film.\n\nHowever, the music is fantastic, opening with a very original and funky tune 'You Should Be True To Your Groove' and continuing with a fabulous jazz piece sung by the talented Eartha Kitt and a classic track by Earth Wind and Fire.\n\nThis is a movie that works on different levels, so that parents will not be bored when watching it with their children. There are a couple of cringe-worthy moments, perhaps aiming for a young teen market but these can be easily overlooked.\n\nOverall a really great movie with some brilliant and original moments.",
