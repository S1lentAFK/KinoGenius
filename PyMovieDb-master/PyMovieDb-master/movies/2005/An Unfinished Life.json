    "reviewBody": "Some have described this as basically a remake of Heidi. Robert Redford has given up on life and spends his time taking care of his ranch hand, played by Morgan Freeman, who was attacked by a grizzly. That right there is enough for me to spend two hours watching a film. Redford and freeman have not disappointed me in the past and i do not expect to ever see a film by them that is not worth watching.\\n\\nNow, add in the fact that we have Jennifer Lopez playing Redford&apos;s daughter-in-law, and the person he blames for the death of his son, showing up on his doorstep with his granddaughter, and you can expect some real sparks to fly and a Lifetime movie to result. Redford, Freeman, & Lopez - Just WHAT do you want from a movie? Grab some popcorn and enjoy.",
