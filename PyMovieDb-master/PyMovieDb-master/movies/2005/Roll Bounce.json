    "reviewBody": "This movie brought back memories long forgotten. I loved to skate as a kid and this movie inspired me to start skating again. I've lost some of the skills I once had...but I recently purchased some new skates and I will be a permanent fixture at the Skating rink. It made me remember how much I loved skating, and watching all the skaters get their jam on was out of this world! Great movie for all ages!! My kids and I will spend a lot of quality time in the rink! If you like good music, super, phenomenal skating skills, go see this movie...you won't regret it. I was jamming in my seat when the music and skating was taking place and I'm sure you will do the same...Enjoy!",
