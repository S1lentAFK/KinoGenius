    "reviewBody": "I too was part of a test audience for this film. I do agree with the last comment about the plot. The script was a little predictable and the one liners seemed a little corny at times.\n\nThe acting however, I thought was great. Ewan McGregor put in a marvelous performance, demonstrating that he is talented and can easily play a wide variety of roles. Naomi Watts, I think also put in a great performance.\n\nOf course, I haven't as yet seen the fully edited theatre version, but so far I think it's a film that should definitely be seen.\n\nA good film in all. 4/5",
