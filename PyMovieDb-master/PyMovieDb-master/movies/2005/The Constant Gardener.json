    "reviewBody": "There are some flaws in the story, however that is not my main concern with this film. While some people might enjoy the type of cinematography this film had, for me I felt like it ruined the entire film. This type of random cinematography cheapened the film in my opinion, and I also did not like the color palette they put it with either. As stories about corruption are very important I think that this was such a shame, because the film simply lost me because of this and I felt disconnected the message it wanted me to come across. However I do like the theme of the film, and I certainly think more films should be made about corruption and the less fortunate, just not in this way.",
