    "reviewBody": "I hated it.\n\nMy two kids (5 and 7) thought it was the best movie of all time. And they&apos;ve seen lots of movies. Let&apos;s face it: we can&apos;t always dictate what the kids should like. This one simply appeals to them, and from a parents perspective, its basically harmless (except to the older crowd - then it is painfully boring).\n\nI would recommend bringing a book.\n\nOr a pillow and a sweater.\n\nOr, at least some thoughts that you wanted to concentrate on for a while.",
