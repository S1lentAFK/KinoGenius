    "reviewBody": "This was very entertaining, and not as bad as the rating suggests. The animation is surprisingly smooth and colourful, and the music is excellent and very fitting with the action. Tom and Jerry are their usual likable selves, and don't speak like they did in the rather disappointing Tom and Jerry: The Movie, and I will say the opening scene indeed was hilarious. Their antics are pretty close to the original show too, and that was wonderful to see. The plot isn't the best in terms of construction, but it still works, though the obvious title holds no surprises. In fact, my only real complaint is that the film is too short, but other than that, it is hugely enjoyable, and i am sure kids will love it. 8/10 Bethany Cox",
