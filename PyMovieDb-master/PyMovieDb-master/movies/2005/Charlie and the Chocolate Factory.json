    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie in Antwerp at a sponsored movie event on the 4th of July.... I was a bit reluctant to go and watch this movie but I&apos;m glad I did! Johnny Depp is a great Willy Wonka! I never thought that there would be a version that could match or even beat the original, but this one certainly has exceeded my expectations.... The film is hilarious, speaking as an adult, I wonder how the youth responds to this, but I rate this movie 8 out of 10 stars!\\n\\nFor those of you expecting a copy of the original with new actors, you&apos;ll be surprised how original this version is, go and bring your entire family with you! I&apos;m sorry for the fact that this comment looks a bit like a commercial, but I&apos;m really enthusiastic about this flick!",
