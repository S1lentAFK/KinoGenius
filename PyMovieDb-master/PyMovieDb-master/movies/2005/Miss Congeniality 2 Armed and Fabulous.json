    "reviewBody": "I loved the first Miss Congeniality movie, and while this movie was better than I thought, it was merely average, and compared to the original, rather disappointing. Sandra Bullock does shine with her charm as Gracie Hart, and she makes the best out of a rather uneven script, that was rather obvious at times. Regina King is above average as her partner Sam. There are some lovely clothes that Gracie gets to wear, and there are some laughs over Dolly Parton's real boobs and Gracie's fake ones, or something along those lines. Unfortunately, everything else is not as impressive. The villains, responsible for the kidnapping of Stan and Miss USA, were lame, and were given little to do. William Shatner as Stan is given next to nothing to do, and it does show in his performance, which was not like his slightly overplayed performance in the first film. The plot, I thought was the main flaw, it was a nice idea, but on screen, it came across as rather formulaic and predictable, not to mention confusing at times. Another problem was the pace, some of the film regrettably was a bit too slow for my liking. Overall, the plot and the script bring down the spirited performances of Bullock and King, and while the sequel was a nice try, you may want to stick with the first film instead. 5/10 for effort.
