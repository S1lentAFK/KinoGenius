    "reviewBody": "Two solid hours of efficient Netflix content is what's on offer here, the action-thriller equivalent of emptiness with nothing but cliche thrillers and mediocre action.\nThe Gray Man is mostly a collection of tired spy tropes, directed in a muddled and baffling way, that seemingly exists to set up what seems like will be a fairly unimaginative franchise.\nThe dialogues were cringe and didn't excite at all. The only grace was seeing Ryan Gosling on screen. A big budget film with neither strong screenplay nor efficient set up, The Gray Man feels like a sunk ship with lots of efforts vanishing in vain.\nAside from two hand-to-hand combat scenes, the fights are a dimly-lit mess of quick cuts and bullets flying, something similar to what Michael Bay has done all over these years.\nBeing a big budget film, The Gray Man is a disappointment to a greater extent, considering that the project had A List actors, but a poor storyline.\nMy Rating: 5/10.",
