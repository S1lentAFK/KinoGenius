    "reviewBody": "As you may or may not know John Cena&apos;s film &apos;12 Rounds&apos; was released in Australia on the 19th of March.\\n\\nJust got home from seeing it and i have to say it was great. Good, solid movie all the way through. Having Renny Harlin as director obviously helped make this a much better effort than previous WWE films. Don&apos;t want to give away too much cause i really think people will actually like this movie and that they should go see it. Good cast - Brain J White was by far the stand out. But I have to say John&apos;s performance was so much better this time around and you really can notice a difference between his acting ability in &apos;12 Rounds&apos; and &apos;The Marine&apos;. He&apos;s not as tense and you can actually believe what he&apos;s saying. There are little tiny things (maybe like 2 moments in the film) that your like &apos;as if that could really happen&apos; but the story keeps you too focused to really care.\\n\\nIf you like car chases, you&apos;ll like this. If you like John Cena, you&apos;ll like this. If you like a little Drama/Romance (Ladies?), you&apos;ll like this.\\n\\nGo see it, I swear you&apos;ll be surprised.",
