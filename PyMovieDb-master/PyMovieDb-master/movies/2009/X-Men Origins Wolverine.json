    "reviewBody": "I have no idea as to why people bash Wolverine. I think its an extremely well made, highly entertaining movie with great acting and a fitting storyline. Its also pretty dark and uncompromising in many scenes.\\n\\nThe fight scenes are brutal and intense which makes them really awesome. \\n\\nI was actually surprised by some of the plot twists. Great.\\n\\nThe opening title sequence should win some kind of award. Gave me goose bumps. The editing is perfect.\\n\\nOnly complaint is the few plot holes towards the X-men trilogy.",
