    "reviewBody": "When I saw the cast, I put this on my watchlist, regardless of any ratings. Christopher Walken is his usual freak self and wait until you see Morgan Freeman and Macy's haircuts...hilarious on their own. I found the film engaging and humorous...not a roll on the floor comedy, just humorous. Worth a watch",
