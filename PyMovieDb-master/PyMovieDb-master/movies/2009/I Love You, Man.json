    "reviewBody": "Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) is a real estate agent, and his girlfriend Zooey Rice (Rashida Jones) just accepted his marriage proposal. Everything is looking great, but then she along with her friends start to notice that he has no male friends. He goes on a search for a best friend and encounters Sydney Fife (Jason Segel) at one of his open house.\\n\\nIt&apos;s a little awkward at the start before Jason Segel. It has some funny moments especially with Thomas Lennon and throwing up on Jon Favreau. But Paul Rudd solo desperately needs a wing man. That&apos;s what the movie is about. But the comedy is hit and miss without it. Rudd and Segal have good chemistry. Mostly it works well. There are some good funny jokes in this.",
