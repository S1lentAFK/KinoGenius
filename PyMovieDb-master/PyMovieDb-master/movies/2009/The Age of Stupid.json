    "reviewBody": "Thank The Heavens!! If films like this and al gore are the force behind committing economic suicide then rest assured my follow friends who posses commonsense....we are safe for now! What a self serving holy then thou piece of nonsense this film is. It seeks only to provoke emotion and all commonsense is regarded as being evil earth hating thoughts. You may think this film will only serve to excite the disciples of global warming, but in fact it does much more.....It proves (to the independent thinker) how far the religion of global warming has come, this movie will scare most into avoiding the cult not joining it!!!",
