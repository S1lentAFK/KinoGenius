    "reviewBody": "I now believe that 2009 should be dubbed the year of the Romcom.\n\nI was dragged to see the proposal by my girlfriend and thought it was hilarious. When she wanted to go and see The Ugly Truth I found myself putting up less of a fight this time. And I'm glad.\n\nThis film is HILARIOUS. I have to say I enjoyed almost every second from start to finish. It truly is designed for both men and women with fantastic views on romance, sex, attraction etc from both sides.\n\nActing is great, story is great and the chemistry between Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler works very well on screen.\n\nTo sum this film up I have to say watch it. Make your own mind up. But I bet you won't be disappointed and I bet you can't stop yourself from one agreeing with some of the points made and two laughing out loud.",
