    "reviewBody": "I don't necessarily know if this movie should be dragged as much as it is, because it's not trash. The premise is kinda campy once you realize that it's not actually real and it is somewhat problematic to piggyback on the real-life tragedies of a small town in Alaska. However, taking the movie for what it is, it's not terrible. It's not great, but it's not terrible. It's enough to make you feel weird about owls though.",
