    "reviewBody": "I don't want to spend too much time on this one simply because it doesn't deserve it. Well the movie has a weak storyline and all every twist felt like we knew that it'd happen. so story is a disappointment, which ultimately let down the whole movie watching experience. Compared to its first part movie fails to capture our attention though there are some moments of laughter all because of 'Eli the goose' but lack of twists and aimless story creates a dullness so totally trash it.. it is a let down on behalf of the first part. and it is painful when you admired the first one.\\n\\nwhy watch it??\\n\\n1- if you are great fan of the first part. 2- Good for kids.. who doesn't want to meet a bear like BOOG in their childhood. 3- If you love CGI animation. 4- Your friend is letting you borrow this title then it is OK to kill one hours time viewing it. 5- if you don't bother about the story at all.",
