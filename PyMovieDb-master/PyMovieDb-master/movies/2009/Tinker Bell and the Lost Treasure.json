I was really curious to see the sequel after TB1 was highly satisfactory for the whole family. I watched it about a couple of dozen times with the little one. Now this new DVD would experience the hard times the first one did until now... but I grabbed it to our NMT and put the media to safety. I can nothing but recommend it. Really nice animation, eye candy from the beginning to the end, nice story, nice message. Most of the characters from the first TB got just marginal appearances, on the other way others were promoted. This one was more about Tink, less about interaction between the fairies like in the first one, but imo the movie did not suffer because of that. All in all - 8/10",
