    "reviewBody": "The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift Directed by Justin Lin Starring: Mitsubishi Evo 9, Nissan Silva, Ford Mustang, RX 7, Toyota Chaser, Lucas Black, Bow Wow, Nathalie Kelly, Sung Kang, Sonny Chiba\\n\\nI think the Mitsubishi should get a best actor nomination for next year's Oscars.\\n\\nNice cars. Nice music. Nice bodies. Nice cityscape.\\n\\nBrainless story. But that's what I watched it for, to have my brains parked outside the cinema and let the brainlessness drive me through a two hour entertainment.\\n\\nThe RX7 has more expression than all the actors.\\n\\nC - Because it served its purpose in entertaining me with awesome drifts, over-sized exhaust pipes, and kick butt photography for a car racing film.",
