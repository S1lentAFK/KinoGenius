    "reviewBody": "I payed my money and saw this movie expecting a laugh and to leave with a smile on my face. I wasn't expecting Oscar acting, a great storyline or something that would leave a lasting impression on me.\n\nThe performances were good, I especially enjoyed Michael Douglas's glam OTT character. The main actors also impressed and I was drawn into their romance as the film went on. So much so that I shed a little tear at the end.\n\nWhen I left the cinema I was smiling and during the movie I laughed out loud along\n\nwith many other people. I got what I paid for and had a good night.",
