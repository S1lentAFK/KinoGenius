    "reviewBody": "This isn't about the movie, it's about the comment above that asserts that Jerichow is an area in east Germany that faces the North Atlantic.\n\nEast Germany has a coast line on the Baltic sea.\n\nThe rest of Germany has borders with Poland, West Germany and the Czech Republic\n\nBefore you get to the north Atlantic you have to go through the north sea, and maybe the English channel (if you go that way).\n\nSo Jerichow is no where near the North Atlantic.\n\nThe rest of that comment should, therefore, be ignored in it's entirety.",
