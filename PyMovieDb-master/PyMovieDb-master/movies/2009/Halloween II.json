    "reviewBody": "Haddonfield is once again tormented by Michael Myers, Laurie is still trying to come to terms with events, Dr Loomis is trying to sell his book.\\n\\nI quite enjoyed the first film, I thoroughly enjoyed this second, it offers up something a little bit different, instead of it simply being a violence only shocker, this one really is an absolute horror fest, the stuff of nightmares. It's bleak, it's twisted, it certainly doesn't hold back.\\n\\nI mentioned violence, and as with the first there is a lot of it, the violence is brutal and relentless, but this time it's more purposeful, it leaves you breathless.\\n\\nMichael is seriously imposing, providing physical and mental threats, he's remorseless, he really is out for revenge. The scene where Michael is stood in the headlights, hooded up, that's one of the most striking moments.\\n\\nThe visuals are impressive too, it looks great, the nightmarish black and white sequences look really impressive, and in some way explain why he's doing what he does. I loved the music too, it works at every level, you'll never listen to Nights in White Satin in the same way again, the iconic theme tune is used very sparingly, that worked very well.\\n\\nI always wish Zombie had done a third, it would have been interesting to see a Season of The Witch, Zombi style.\\n\\n8/10.",
