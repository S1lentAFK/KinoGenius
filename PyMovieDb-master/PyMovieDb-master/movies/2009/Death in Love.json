    "reviewBody": "It's a very hard character study. Self loathing, love, betrayal and twisted life is gruesomely portrayed here with no compromise. Not everyone can go on making this movie, I'm just glad I found it. Top notch job guys. Specially Lucas, Bissett and Hall. They gave everything to their character. If you think of yourself as a hardcore cinephile and love character study, go after it. If not, then plz don't try. It's not for you, you won't stay on for long either.",
