    "reviewBody": "The characters were annoying,cast was annoying,nearly every scene have deaths so there were a small and fastened plot,which was bad. But it was still watchable and original bloody carnage movie. Like Hunt&apos;s death and the Mechanic-with-no-spine. As I say,the worst of the series,but not boring.",
