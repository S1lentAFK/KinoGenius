    "reviewBody": "Yes, as many other reviewers have eluded, the movie can be a bit dry. My wife got lost in the message because she lost interest rather quickly. It wasn&apos;t until I explained the message the movie was trying to convey that she seemingly became more interested.\\n\\n**spoiler** Watch it until the end, the message is rather powerful. I specifically liked the ending because (Sasha) Stanley&apos;s wife allowed herself to fall in the same class when the nurse made her fill the paperwork while Stanley is having a heart attack. In this instance, I felt like I would have called BS and told the nurse to get a doctor ASAP, instead of calmly filling out the paperwork like she was doing. But then again, that&apos;s exactly the message the movie was delivering, that we easily follow orders without question even against what we think is right.",
