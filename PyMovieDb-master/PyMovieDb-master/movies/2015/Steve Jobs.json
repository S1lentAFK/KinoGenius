    "reviewBody": "This movie is a dramatization, based on stuff that really happened, and it is a really cool movie.\\n\\nNo, this movie isn&apos;t meant to show history exactly as it happened. If you want to know all that read the book by Walter Isaacson. It&apos;s a great book.\\n\\nThe script is pure Sorkin-Porn. Rapid-fire dialogue with 2 conversations going on at the same time. If you liked The West Wing or any of Aaron Sorkin&apos;s other movies, you&apos;ll feel at home with this one.\\n\\nThey also get the small emotional moments right as well. Some of the best moments are between Steve and his daughter.\\n\\nThe directing and editing is masterful. I liked the choice to shoot on different formats for the different years and the flashback scenes punctuate the drama on screen perfectly. \\n\\nAll the actors do a fine job, especially Michael Stuhlbarg who plays Andy Hertzfeld.\\n\\nI hope when they release this movie on blu ray they include the video of the real Steve doing these product launches as bonus features.\\n\\nIf you can get past the fact that this movie isn&apos;t a word for word recreation of history, you will enjoy it.",
