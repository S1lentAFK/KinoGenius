    "reviewBody": "A tight script? Check. Capable actors? Check. Lots of witty dialogue? Check. A jazzy soundtrack? Check. Beautiful photography in idyllic settings? Check.\\n\\nYes, all the ingredients are there. Just leave it to the 79-year old chef to create a delicious dish out of it. When everything is right, a Woody Allen movie is a delight to watch. And with &apos;Irrational Man&apos;, this is absolutely the case.\\n\\nJoaquin Phoenix and Emma Stone are clearly enjoying themselves as the grumpy philosophy professor and his admiring student and lover. Allen&apos;s script plays in a lighthearted way with serious philosophical concepts such as guilt, evil and righteousness. Also, he throws in a murder mystery and makes the suspense last until the very end.\\n\\n&apos;Irrational Man&apos; will not be one of Allen&apos;s greatest movies, because it lacks an extraordinary element like Cate Blanchett&apos;s performance in &apos;Blue Jasmine&apos;, or the historical dimension of &apos;Midnight in Paris&apos;. But even without such an extra ingredient, &apos;Irrational Man&apos; shows an expert craftsman at work. In a couple of years time, it might just turn out to be one of his most underrated films.",
