    "reviewBody": "Sometimes I really don&apos;t get IMDb and critics I avoided this movie like the plague as it had such low ratings by users and critics, so I thought it would be a complete waste of time But I&apos;ve upgraded my home projector recently, and it supports 3D, and since then, I&apos;m having fun in trying this format. Wachowski&apos;s always make great visuals, so I jumped into it because of the 3D, but with very low expectations regarding the movie To my complete surprise, it turned out the movie was very good, in the sense it was highly entertaining The story has it&apos;s flaws, like any regular movie, but it&apos;s not a complete nonsense like some people try to sell you Can&apos;t understand how rubbish movies like Fast&Furious 7 and Iron Man 3 make millions at the box office and have such good ratings, where this one flopped and has such poor ones I mean even complete trash like Godzilla, Robocop (2014), John Carter and San Andreas have a higher score than Jupiter Ascending!!! What a hell is going on with you people?",
