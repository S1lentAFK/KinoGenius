    "reviewBody": "Here we go again with the negative reviewers. I wonder what&apos;s wrong with those people? You are not going to tell me that this is the worst horror movie you ever saw, because then you talk a lot of bull... Okay it&apos;s not the best movie about possession or exorcism but it sure ain&apos;t the worst one. You can not compare it with The Exorcist because that movie was one of the first one about that subject and for that time it had everyone on the tip of their chair. Linda Blair will probably remain the best actress as a possessed person but it doesn&apos;t mean that other actors can&apos;t play that role. I thought Olivia Taylor Dudley did a good job with her performance. Looking innocent and then pure evil, to me it all looked real, and that&apos;s what&apos;s it all about with movies like this one. I surely was entertained and I saw hundreds of worse horror movies then The Vatican Tapes. Don&apos;t believe the haters here because they don&apos;t know what they are talking about.",
