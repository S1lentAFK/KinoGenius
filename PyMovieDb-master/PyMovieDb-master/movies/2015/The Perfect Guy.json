    "reviewBody": "The movie is good! I did feel like they ruined his (Carter ) character in the movie a bit too soon. It would have been a great plot twist to allow the 2 (Leah & Carter) to grow closer then maybe have Cater start to grow jealous of her Ex.\\n\\nIt was ruined so suddenly at the gas station and things shifted really fast!\\n\\nIf his good guy character could have lasted a little longer, things would have been more intriguing.",
