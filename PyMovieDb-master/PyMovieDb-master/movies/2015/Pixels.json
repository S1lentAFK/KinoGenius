    "reviewBody": "I'm not sure why such a low rating. This is easily one of the better Sandler flicks in my book, and there aren't actually that many I like. It's fun, nothing's taken too seriously, it's well-acted and well-directed, there's a minimum of the obligatory shock humor that seems to invade all of his movies. I mean, you could probably let the kids watch and that stuff will go over their heads. Maybe, maybe not. Watch it yourself first.\n\nI watched it a second time and still enjoyed it. That doesn't happen all that often.",
