    "reviewBody": "Well, OK, it had some sucky components.\n\nAs usual - \n\n* Overblown characters with excessive dwelling on them doing cartoony, cute, 'stuff', as a substitute for actual development. And them doing ridiculous things that nobody would actually do.\n\n* Speechy-preachy dialogue.\n\n* Long, drawn-out scenes, over and over - except that this time most of them - MOST of them - actually *contribute* to the overall effect rather than just boring the viewer.\n\n* Focus on the completely wrong targets: the guy always makes the film he thinks he's making, rather than the one the viewers actually end up seeing, so you end up with these completely non-sequitur, irrelevant 'development' scenes. In this case there is a completely tacked-on pre-ending that leaves the viewer going 'Why is this here? Why are we supposed to care?'\n\n-\n\nAmazingly, NONE of which destroys it:\n\n-\n\nThe intro is attention-grabbing.\n\nThe build-up is stately and involving.\n\nThe Weird piles-on quite disturbingly.\n\nAnd the twist is a GOOD one instead of something DUMB!\n\n-\n\nThis is the first thing I've seen since The 6th Sense that wasn't write-off rubbish.\n\nMaybe he's got on, or off, the right medication?? \n\n- \n\n-- \n\n---",
