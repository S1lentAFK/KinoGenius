    "reviewBody": "ROGUE NATION has a lot of excellent action sequences which make it one of the best action movies of all time. Tom Cruise drives all the action with energy, while Christopher McQuarrie directs with full intensity. Rebecca Ferguson is a worthy inclusion in the cast. She excels in the action sequences, making her one of the top action heroines in today's times. The entire cast acts with the same energy and intensity. Action sequences elevate the film to a higher level. The chase sequences are so breakneck that you'd have to be an ignorant viewer not to like them. There are good twists as well, and the scale is huge as always. The MI franchise has always improved on the next film, and this one proves me right.",
