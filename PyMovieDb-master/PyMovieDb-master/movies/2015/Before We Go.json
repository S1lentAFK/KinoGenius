    "reviewBody": "this is the first film directed by Chris Evans that I saw.it is well directed,well acted. it has an interesting and delicate perspective on love,lost,sadness and making choices based on profound love and not a little lust. I liked a lot and I enjoyed seeing it 2 times.both actors are comfortable in this position,I liked that there is no much passion and more friendship and real understanding.it is more a chick flick,but if there is a man who wants to be true to himself ,he will also enjoy it.it is wonderful and you will feel good about love and life and yourself ,you will feel hope and happy to be alive after seeing it.enjoy.",
