    "reviewBody": "Adam Jones (Bradley Cooper) had a meltdown as a two-star Michelin chef in Paris. He was addicted to drugs, alcohol, and women. He burnt down all his bridges, and spent the last couple of years shucking a million oysters in New Orleans. Now clean and sober, he decides to achieve the third star in London. He convinces ma\\u00eetre d&apos; Tony to get him started. He recruits many of the old mates and some new ones including sous-chef Helene (Sienna Miller).\\n\\nBradley Cooper is doing an angry brat looking for salvation. This movie crystallizes when his character tells the therapist that he&apos;s gathering a team like the Seven Samurai. Most of these characters become story constructs. There are still good stuff here. I like Sienna Miller and her character. The longer she held out against the inevitable romance, the better her character is. I like the switch with the villain of the movie. I&apos;m always up for some food porn. Overall, it&apos;s too formulaic, too much flash, but is good enough of a watch.",
