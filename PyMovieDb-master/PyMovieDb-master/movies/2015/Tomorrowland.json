    "reviewBody": "That's what Tomorrowland is about. Hope. And imagination. It's a film that makes you believe in the future. Sadly, it seems that many of the reviewers here have lost that belief, and blame that on the film. Tomorrowland is not about how to change the world - it's about believing that we can. And we need that belief more than ever in our depressing modern society.\n\nTomorrowland is about the power of believing. It's not a blueprint for how to change the world - because the point of the story is that there is no blueprint. It's up to us to believe in the future. That's not too vague for me, and it shouldn't be too vague for you. This film makes you believe in the possibilities of the future. Watch it and tank up on hope and imagination.",
