    "reviewBody": "Slightly dark but charmingly funny with a great cast and dialogue. I love Scott Foley and as soon as I saw that he directed and wrote the screenplay I decided to check it out and I'm glad I did. I won't go into spoiler territory other than to say murder as never been so charming and breezy. Definitely worth checking out.",
