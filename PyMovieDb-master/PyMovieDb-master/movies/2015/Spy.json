    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed this for some stress-relief. Yes, it is very vulgar quite often. But I adore Miranda Hart, Jude Law is some suave damn eye-candy, Melissa is funny as always and it was nice seeing her take on an action role. Stratham must have needed something as light relief from his usual British crime seriousness; he does idiot well, it turns out. And Rose Byrne was an adorable, lethal, spoilt brat. \\n\\nJust some fun. Maybe I could have done without male porn bits. That &apos;thing&apos;, I don&apos;t know if it was real but it was repulsive. Eww.",
