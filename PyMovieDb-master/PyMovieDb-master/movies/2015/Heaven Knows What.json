    "reviewBody": "I guess I&apos;m writing this review after seeing the one and only other review. This film is actually really very good, and for what its showing: perfect. Time is different for some people. Those with heroin in their lives don&apos;t live as we do. For them time doesn&apos;t really exist.\\n\\nThere is a flow and it is somewhat linear though quantum leaps here and there are possible at anytime. \\n\\nThere is always need.\\n\\nThe opening is a dream. One of Harley&apos;s perfect moments in &apos;time&apos; smashed by a realisation. She has to kill herself for the man she loves? Combine this with Heroins ebb and flow and it becomes even more intense. \\n\\nLove unrequited but really Ilya loves Harley too... right? \\n\\nWhat will you do for love? Anything. What will you do for Heroin? Almost anything?\\n\\nThe film flows through days and night though really we are just allowed to view their lives for a short train ride. The end is Malick in style - life just keeps on flowing. \\n\\nI read up a little on Arielle Holmes (Harley) - she has lived the lifestyle, and some parts of the film are based on her adventures!\\n\\nIt&apos;s very realistic. Just watch it all, let it flow.\\n\\nOh also, the use of modular synths and sound instead of voice (in parts) is very effective, the latter trying something new and it worked.",
