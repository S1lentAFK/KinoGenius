    "reviewBody": "Glad I rented this, instead of seeing it at a theater. I&apos;m shocked Reese Witherspoon agreed to this film. A very poor, silly comedy. I did however, see a glimpse of good acting ability in Sofia, when she showed her evil, serious side. I believe she could portray a great criminal, but that glimpse was simply that, a 20-30 second glimpse. I must admit, my wife was laughing and giggling throughout the movie at some of the more female oriented jokes. She seemed to enjoy it much more than I did. I was shaking my head almost the entire film. There was just too much slap stick to suit me. If you are a Sofia fan, you need to rent this. I don&apos;t think they could have showed much more of her body than they did without going to a higher rating. She is nice to look at but that screaming she does gets a bit irritating after a while. The film was only around an hour and thirty minutes long, I don&apos;t think I could have lasted much longer.",
