    "reviewBody": "Despite the movie is a over the top comedy that is ridiculous and sometimes straight out offensive and disgusting, the movie makes you laugh. I haven&apos;t laughed like this for a good while, so it does however do its job as a comedy. if you are however looking for a calm comedy that takes itself a little bit serious..... stay away XD It contains offensive jokes, foul language (often from the small ones) over-dramatic scenes with plot twists, scrap that! there is plot twists everywhere, but the movie is for some reason able to keep you entertained as you try to pick up all the popcorn you dropped on the floor after laughing hysterically from a really bad line that just turns even more awkward as the other character replies back. A must watch mess for the ones that needs a good laugh, and bring a friend. It makes the movie 10 time better when a cheap but funny line comes up and both of you can relate XD",
