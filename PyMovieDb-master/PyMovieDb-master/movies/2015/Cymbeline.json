    "reviewBody": "before I finally shut it off. There art nay words to pray pardon me how awful this movie is. \\n\\nFor the most part I thought it was a joke, or that something was going to happen and it would turn into a real movie eventually. I came here before renting and the summary seemed pretty decent, and the cast looks amazing! The IMDb summary is completely misleading having never heard of this movie before (and now I know why I hadn&apos;t). I&apos;m a little upset I paid 4 bucks to rent this. That&apos;s 4 dollars and 45 minutes I can&apos;t get back. And I&apos;m more upset about the 45 minutes. The summary NEEDS to say something about it being an attempt to modernize a Shakespeare...something - or whatever it was attempting to do. I seriously have never seen anything so horrible in my life - I find it near incomprehensible why anyone would even mildly consider producing something like this. I feel like I should cry a little bit over all the time and money wasted on this mess.",
