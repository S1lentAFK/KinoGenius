    "reviewBody": "This movie is just like so many other movies... but then it's not. It's quite transparent and obvious, but equally entertaining, well paced and emotional, with quite a few pretty hilarious moments.\n\nWhile it is in no way epic, and does not answer any deep questions or will change the way you think or influence your life in any way, it will leave you smiling for a while.\n\nDecent story, nice funny moments and pretty great casting (imho). I very much like most of the characters, some well known actors and very good behind camera work from Courteney Cox, no less.\n\nDefinitely a recommendation for a dull evening, especially if you're feeling blue. Very positive energy.",
