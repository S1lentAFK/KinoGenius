    "reviewBody": "12th Fail is a bold movie and movies like this must be made more frequently.\\n\\nAlas, nowadays making such movies isn't possible easily because masses are more inclined to watch poorly made but highly promoted movies like Kashmir Files or Kerala story.\\n\\nThis will surely inspire many and will give morale boost to many aspirants and will give it's viewer to think after watch.\\n\\nDirection is superb and acting of Vikrant Messy is top notch.\\n\\nAll Hail Vikrant Massey & Vidhu Vinod Chopra As They Shape The Most Pure, Personal & Brave Hindi Film In A Long Time.\\n\\n12th Fail deserves an audience, and we, as cinephiles, deserve cinema that respects us. Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Vikrant Massey have served one.",
