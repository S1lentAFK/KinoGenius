    "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t know why so many people have a downer on this.I took my 7yo and 3yo boys to this and they really liked it!\n\nI thought it was OK, not great but OK easy to watch. Now is that not what a kids film should be? Too many people out there think they are experts, just relax man and watch the movie.\n\nInstead of writing crap about every film, it&apos;s unfair as myself as a parent checked the reviews for this. I am pleased I ignored them as I have my suspicions about a lot of these reviewers. This is a long line now in poor reviews which turn out to be decent movies. End result the kids had a good time watching a nice gentle movie with some laughs-get over yourselves.",
