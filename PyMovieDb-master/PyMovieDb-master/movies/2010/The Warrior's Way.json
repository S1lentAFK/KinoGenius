    "reviewBody": "Imagine a Sergio Leone western with swords. The setting is as sparse as the dialogue but you don&apos;t sit through one of his works for the acting or the plot. Warrior&apos;s Way is like that. What it lacks is made up in other ways. The choreography is above average, the CGI seamless and the set pieces pure art. And it&apos;s all cleverly portrayed, captured and presented. An enjoyable little gem from the genre.",
