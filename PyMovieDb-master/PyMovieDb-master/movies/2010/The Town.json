    "reviewBody": "I had a trip to &apos;the town&apos; last night and well, it is surprisingly entertaining. I still can&apos;t believe Ben Affleck can pull off everything (story, screenplay, direction, starring in a lead role) with such an ease. Three years after his debut directional venture &apos;Gone Baby Gone&apos;, Ben comes up with an ever better one this time.\n\nA perfect combo of sold story, captivating screenplay, amazing writing, brilliant character development, good emotional content and brilliant cinematography (watch out for the shaky camera, this is the best camera work I&apos;ve seen after &apos;Bourne&apos; series) all together delivers an entertaining action thriller...worth a watch.",
