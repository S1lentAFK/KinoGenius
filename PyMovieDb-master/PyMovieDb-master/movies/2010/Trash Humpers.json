    "reviewBody": "...but certainly not very good, either.\n\nBelieve it or not, there were a few things about this movie that I genuinely liked. I found some of the weird comedy to be hilarious and laughed out loud several times throughout the film. I also thought that Korine did a pretty good job at creating a really dirty and disturbing atmosphere. These elements of both comedy and horror both work to make the movie at least watchable at times, but unfortunately do not save it from being just an overall bad movie.\n\nPerhaps I found it to not be absolutely TERRIBLE only because of how low my expectations were before watching this oddity. I thought it looked like, well, trash-but then I found some highly well done aspects and thought that this movie could possibly be okay, but then it just dragged on and on and on. At just 70 minutes, this is a needlessly long movie that easily could have been half as long and much better.\n\nI would also like to comment on the film&apos;s annoying and ugly visual style. It&apos;s obvious that it was an experimental, stylistic choice to have the movie shot on crappy looking video, and it does work slightly to the films advantage to make it seem more creepy and trashy, but it just doesn&apos;t appeal to me in any way. There&apos;s other, more tolerable ways to make your movie look sort of real and dirty.\n\nI would not recommend this movie to most people, but if you&apos;re curious enough and a big fan of Harmony Korine&apos;s work, I would give it a mild and cautious recommendation.",
