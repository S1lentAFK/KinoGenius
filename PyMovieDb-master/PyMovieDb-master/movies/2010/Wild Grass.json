    "reviewBody": "Up to a point, it is a great movie with beautiful cinematography and valid questions about important social issues, deserving of 8 starts, by my standards. However, the message of this movie is not unambiguously positive, therefore appropriate ending and commentary had to be added. If this was a way of getting this movie through, so be it.",
