    "reviewBody": "The Trotsky is a teen-comedy with a hint of Goodbye Lenin&apos;s political satire and Charlie Bartlett&apos;s humour/plot. Although some of the acting seems mediocre, I enjoyed the film.\n\nYou don&apos;t need to understand the biography of Leon Trotsky, it explains it in a subtle way that is enough to enjoy the film, but doing research beforehand might be a decent idea.\n\nDon&apos;t take this film too seriously, just enjoy it for what it is. It isn&apos;t like a normal film, it&apos;s sort of a modern teen-comedy about revolting against injustice, although the injustice is rather insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWell-done, worth watching, but only if you have an open mind and enjoy quirky films about adolescent injustice.",
