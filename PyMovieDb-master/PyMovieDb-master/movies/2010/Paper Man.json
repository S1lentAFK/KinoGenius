    "reviewBody": "Rule 1, never watch a trailer, I watched it AFTER watching the film and am seriously questioning the mental state of the head of marketing of this film. It is not a comedy, it is a character piece, a drama I guess, but NOT A COMEDY.\n\nIt&apos;s good, I liked it, for me a 7/10 is a solid film, not bad, but not a a masterpiece. The strength comes from the amazingly good acting and writing. It makes you feel stuff, including awkward, which is good, because that is what movies are supposed to do. Don&apos;t be swayed, everything in this film is deliberate, if you felt it, the director wanted you to feel it, that is what good films do.\n\nAs I said, acting and writing is superb, and it really comes together in the last act. Starts slow, but it&apos;s not boring, just hang on.\n\nI think Captain Excellent works, I don&apos;t really know why other people think it didn&apos;t, but I never mind breaking the immersion of reality in films.\n\nGood film, go watch if you like characters and stuff.",
