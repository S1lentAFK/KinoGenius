    "reviewBody": "I dont like this movie, it was cringe. The acting was bad, the story is questionable, and it&apos;s just weird. But, it&apos;s so bad that there is a point it&apos;s likable because it&apos;s bad. I know i sound like i am on drugs, but it&apos;s just how i see the movie XD. Like, the reason why i dont like it, is the same reason why i do like it. You know what i mean? But if i just pay attention to the movie itself, its bad.",
