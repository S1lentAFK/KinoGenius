    "reviewBody": "Two British men kidnap the daughter of a rich man and hold her prisoner while negotiating a ransom. It&apos;s tightly constructed and the suspense builds amid the changing dynamics of the relationship among the three characters. What keeps it from being a good film, however, is the stupidity of the characters, particularly Alice, the victim, who squanders opportunities to escape because of her idiotic actions. Of course, in these kinds of films, such behavior is used primarily to propel the plot, otherwise the story would end too quickly. Still, it&apos;s an impressive feature film debut for writer-director Blakeson and is worth a look.",
