    "reviewBody": "Pat Tillman Jr. was a professional football player who left the field to enlist in the army after September 11, 2001 with his brother for a three year tour of duty. Sadly, he died in mysterious circumstances. This documentary follows Pat&apos;s career and life with interviews from his parents, siblings, friends, widow, and others. Worse than his loss to his family, friends, and fellow soldiers was the cover-up from the government about the nature of his death whether murder or intent. Pat Tillman&apos;s death was never fully explained to the public or even his family. The Tillmans want the truth no matter if it was an accident of friendly fire or enemy fire. At this point, it doesn&apos;t matter. Pat is still gone but his family have unanswered questions about who and what killed him. The truth is needed for closure. When the Tillmans go to Washington DC, they are dismayed by the ridiculous behavior of congress and witnesses like Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The Tillmans have questions to be answered and aren&apos;t going to be in the near future.",
