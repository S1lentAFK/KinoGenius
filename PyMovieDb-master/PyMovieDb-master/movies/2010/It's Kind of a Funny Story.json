    "reviewBody": "A depressed teen admits himself into a psych ward & meets some colorful folks.\n\nComplex issues switched up and told in a free-spirited way. There's nothing sugar-coated about these characters, which is probably why I like them so much. Pluses for having them relate to our current society; these characters could be someone on your own street.\n\nWith a narrative & creative style similar to 500 Days of Summer, this is an oddly inspirational tale. \n\nComic relief provided by the excellent Zack Galifianakis.\n\nGreat music, great film!",
