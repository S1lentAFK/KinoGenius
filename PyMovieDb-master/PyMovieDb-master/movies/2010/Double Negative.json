    "reviewBody": "Michael Sarrazin is the journalist who can't remember anything about the night he found his wife raped and murdered on their bed; Susan Clark is his devoted girlfriend, who tries to help him piece the events together. Sounds good, but actually it's a muddled, visually unattractive thriller, with a predictable resolution. Anthony Perkins is fairly amusing as a kinky blackmailer. (*1/2)",
