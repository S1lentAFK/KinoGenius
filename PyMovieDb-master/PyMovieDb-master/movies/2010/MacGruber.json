    "reviewBody": "Okay, I hate to start by blatantly stealing someone else&apos;s quote, but, when reading other reviews of MacGruber, someone else described it as &apos;Team America, but without the puppets.&apos; Yes, I&apos;d say that&apos;s a fair definition - only Team America was very funny and clever. MacGruber has a lot to live up to.\n\nWhen I started watching MacGruber, I hated it. I was totally with those many 1/5 star reviews I&apos;d seen describing it. My main gripes were that it simply wasn&apos;t funny and that the main character (MacGruber, believe it or not) was completely annoying. I was practically on the brink of turning it off after about half an hour, when, to my amazement, I actually laughed.\n\nIt&apos;s possible that by watching half an hour of this film lowered by IQ enough to watch - and enjoy - the rest of it. Okay, so the second half wasn&apos;t comedy gold, but I seemed to have a better idea as to what this film was trying to be and I laughed enough not to qualify this as a complete flop. However, it&apos;s worth noting that this film bombed at the box office, so perhaps I&apos;m in a minority here.\n\nIt&apos;s a (loose) satire on action films where the &apos;burned out hero&apos; is plucked from retirement for &apos;one last mission.&apos; It has been done a fair few times before - Hotshots Part Deux was done nearly twenty years ago (and it&apos;s probably consistently funnier), but it has enough moments (in the second half) to make it just about worth watching.\n\nAnd - seriously - don&apos;t eat the celery.\n\nhttp://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",
