    "reviewBody": "Saw this at Cinema Sundays at the Charles here in Baltimore.\\n\\nThe audience liked it a lot, from their reactions during the film and also at the Q&A. Parker Posey and Demi Moore play two sisters who are faced with taking care of their father in the house where they grew up. Their father, played by Rip Torn, is becoming less and less compos mentis. Not forgetting the wonderful Ellen Barkin, who brings humanity to the role of Shelley, a woman who has reached bottom.\\n\\nThe movie has some pretty trippy sections, a fair amount of things that make you not so sure what&apos;s supposed to be happening in the movie&apos;s reality, and what&apos;s just happening in the head of one of the characters.\\n\\nIt&apos;s primarily a good-natured comedy about people and how they get along. It&apos;s very funny, with some subtle and unexpected laughs. I can&apos;t wait for this to be shown in a local theater so I can see it again.",
