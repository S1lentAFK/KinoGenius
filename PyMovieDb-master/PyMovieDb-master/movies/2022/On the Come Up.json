    "reviewBody": "One of those movies that surely aint bad, but isnt excelling in any way, shape or form either.\n\nWhat we have here is a story of a young African Amercan schoolgirl who is struggling at school, but finds out she has got a talent for rap music.\n\nWhat we get to see is a detailed portrait of the rise in success of her rap music career. In between we get to see several racism issues being highlighted.\n\nThe acting is okay. So is the direction. The story isnt terrible, but very predictable and that is my main complaint with this movie: it is lacking originality and it is lacking in true drama as well.\n\nNot a bad movie, just too predictable and a bit lacking in spark and punch.",
