    "reviewBody": "65/100\n\nKimi doesn&apos;t do nearly as much as it could with its tech-spin premise on the conspiracy thriller, and it certainly is no untouchable masterpiece of character work. The script could have used a little more meat on its bones as it relates to character development and world building.\n\nBut what it does do is just enough. I found this film to be an extraordinarily efficient work of pacing. It&apos;s never so slow that it becomes boring; there&apos;s always something to pay attention to in every scene. And the second half of the film really becomes riveting with constant variety in location, physical threat, and power dynamics.\n\nIt&apos;s certainly a decent thriller, though it&apos;s definitely a lesser work from Steven Soderbergh.",
