    "reviewBody": "Maybe I&apos;m easily pleased but I enjoyed Morbius, it&apos;s not the best Marvel film out there but still very watchable and I never got bored at any time. Don&apos;t go in expecting an Oscar winner film, it&apos;s just a good action film. It definitely doesn&apos;t warrant some of the terrible reviews, everyone thinks they are filmmakers these days.",
