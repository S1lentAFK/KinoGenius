    "reviewBody": "The plot of this film has been done a few dozen times before. Sometimes, the subject matter has been handled sensitively, and most other times the subject matter was handled shabbily. The old story of the birth mother wanting to reunite with the child who has been adopted can easily fall into the cornball acting syndrome. Fortunately for this film and its actors, it does not. The script is intelligent, the actors are believable, and the situation is handled in a sensitive manner. All of these good variables make this an easy decision to recommend this film to the public. The only reservation I have about the film is its overreliance on religion.",
