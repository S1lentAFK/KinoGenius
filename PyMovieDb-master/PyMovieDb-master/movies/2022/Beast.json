    "reviewBody": "I watched this in 4DX, with moving chairs and extra immersion techniques in the theater. It was fun and mindlessly entertaining. Good to watch on a summer weekend where there&apos;s nothing else to do. I&apos;d watch it again on TV. Also, I feel Idris Elba starred in this movie purely to solidify his chances for Bond. He&apos;s made this movie well worth it.",
