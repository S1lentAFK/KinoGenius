    "reviewBody": "If you separate this adaptation from the book, it is a sufficient watch. However, considering what masterpiece it is based on, I&apos;m sure Jane Austen is turning in her grave.\n\nThe story isn&apos;t anything like the Persuasion we know and love, it is trying too hard to be like Bridgerton, to be relevant and have modern touches. Some of the most beloved and iconic lines have been downgraded to weak decoctions. There is hardly any character development. In fact, the only character that I thought wasn&apos;t utterly flat was Mary. The cast is excellent but the script is beyond words... and not in the positive sense. For Anne to constantly be breaking the fourth wall was an excruciatingly bad decision. All in all, a painful adaptation that can surely only be enjoyed by viewers who aren&apos;t familiar with the work of Jane Austen.",
