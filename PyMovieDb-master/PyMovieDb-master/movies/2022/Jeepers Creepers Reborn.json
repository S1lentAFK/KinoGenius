    "reviewBody": "This is one of the worst film I&apos;ve seen from a successful horror franchise ever. I was in shock with how atrocious the acting, directing, effects, and story was. The story goes in some baffling directions, it&apos;s like the writers had never seen a creeper film in their lives. I literally wanted the Creeper to reach through the screen and rip my eyes out to keep me from watching this eye sore. The green screen is so horribly distracting and just takes you out of it.\n\nAND THE KILLS!!! The kills are even worse. How can you mess that up?! Since when does the Creeper use a bear trap? In a house?! Please just put this franchise out of its misery. No competent director will touch this project with a 100 ft pole.",
