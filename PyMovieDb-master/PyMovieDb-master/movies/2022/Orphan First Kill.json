    "reviewBody": "I watched &apos;Orphan&apos; about 3/4 years ago. From then to now, I didn&apos;t expected to watch another prequel . As prequel always comes with disappointment. I can&apos;t say it was that bad but again it wasn&apos;t necessary. After so many years after 13 years!\n\nHowever, when I heard about it, my joys knew no bounds, it&apos;s one of my favourite movies. But,it felt like watching the &apos;Orphan&apos; again but this time, Easter is total psycho and extremely violent. Then the rest story remains the same. Twist was kind of unexpected and this is the only thing that is different from &apos;Orphan &apos;and again the ending story remains same.",
