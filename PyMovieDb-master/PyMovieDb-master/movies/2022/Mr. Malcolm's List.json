    "reviewBody": "How this movie has an average of 5.3 but the disgracefully botched 2022 version of Persuasion, a 5.6, is beyond me. Yes, Mr. Malcolm&apos;s List is Austen-esque and predictable, but at least the script captured the zeitgeist of the early 1800s. Its preview (which is on YouTube) actually came out early 2019, so I&apos;m guessing Bridgerton took a leaf out of their book in regard to a diverse cast.\n\nThe two leads don&apos;t have much chemistry but the cast in general is excellent. I particularly enjoyed Oliver Jackson-Cohen&apos;s Lord Cassidy and although Julia Thistlewaite&apos;s character is downright unpleasant, Zawe Ashton embodied her brilliantly. I&apos;m glad she replaced Gemma Chan, whose performance in the preview I thought a bit spiritless.\n\nAll in all, not an arthouse film experience but definitely worth the watch if you&apos;re into period pieces. I watched it for the second time today and didn&apos;t enjoy it any less than I did the first time.",
