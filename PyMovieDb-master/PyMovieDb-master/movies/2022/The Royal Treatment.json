    "reviewBody": "A script that goes out of its way to touch as many cliches as possible, a supporting cast that seems to have a shared goal of extreme over-acting to highlight the two-dimensionality of their characters, and an overall execution without a coherent vision all conspire to make sure that the chemistry that actually exists between the two lead characters is completely drowned out.",
