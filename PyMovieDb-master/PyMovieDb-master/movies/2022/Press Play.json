    "reviewBody": "Laura (Clara Rugaard) falls for Harrison (Lewis Pullman) who works at a record store. Store owner Cooper (Danny Glover) has put up all the lost mixed tapes on the wall. Harrison makes his own mixed tape for Laura. After a tragedy, Laura discovers that the mixed tape can time travel and she tries to fix history.\n\nThe concept is good, but there isn&apos;t enough material for a full length movie. The movie is already short and the middle drags. Once the first time travel fails, all the other failures become repetitive. That&apos;s the slow part. This is a Twilight Zone episode for about forty minutes. The story needs another layer. The ending is poetic and that saves the movie.",
