    "reviewBody": "There is a car accident in front of Tiffany. There is a mix up with two blue boxes. There are marriage proposals and non-marriage proposals. It&apos;s bad relationships and one budding sweet one. Rachel Meyer (Zoey Deutch) is a New York baker with a bad boyfriend. In Tiffany, Ethan Greene (Kendrick Sampson) is picking a ring with his daughter.\n\nReese Witherspoon&apos;s production company Hello Sunshine is trying to tap into the Sweet Home Alabama jackpot. This one is more a shot at Hallmark cheese than a rom-com hit. It tries to be more, but it fails at that. For me, the biggest issue is construction. I don&apos;t like the love quadrangle. A love triangle functions better. Vanessa&apos;s biggest sin for most of the movie seems to be the weather. The story needs to be rewritten into a love triangle. I would reimagine the Vanessa side by adding some tragedy. Ethan could be picking up the custom-made ring after Vanessa&apos;s tragic death. That would make the construction into a triangle. There are other issues. For example, the staging of the switch is a bit awkward. I would make the switch first before the accident. This rom-com also needs a better meet-cute. I have no suggestions, but there has to be a million better ones than this. I like Zoey Deutch and Kendrick Sampson&apos;s chemistry. They&apos;re a sweet couple. Gary is a horrible boyfriend which works well. There are elements here that could work, but the basic construction is flawed.",
