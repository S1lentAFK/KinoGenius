    "heading": "Odd pacing",
    "reviewBody": "The pacing of this movie felt off for me. When the movie started I thought I missed something because the beginning of their relationship was so rushed. It&apos;s hard to root for a relationship we only see in quick clips. This movie was pretty short so spending 10-15 extra minutes establishing the relationship for the audience probably would&apos;ve helped the romance be a lot more believable. I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s rushed like that in the book too because I haven&apos;t read it but the title is Hello, Goodbye and Everything in Between. The hello is a blip and we are missing a big chunk of that in between part.",
