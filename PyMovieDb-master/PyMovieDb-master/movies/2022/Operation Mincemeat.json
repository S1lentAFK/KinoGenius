    "reviewBody": "The production team clearly had an one too many during the making of this. Why anyone would add fiction to spoil a fascinating historical tale is beyond me.\n\nLets recap -- the Brits decieved Hitler through brilliant trickery into diverting his troops, thereby losing ground to the allies, and ultimately losing the war. If this was pure fiction it would be unbelievable or better told with Marvel characters or Tarantino. However, it wasnt fiction!! So why litter the core story with contrived subplots? The relationship between Montague and Jean was nonsense. Unrealistic. Irrelevant. Was it perhaps because someone promised Colin it was a love story to get him involved? Add to this, whilst the script and dialogue was largely good, at times it was awful. These were brainfreeze moments. Casting and performances were generally good, especially Matthew M and Penelope Wilton.\n\nI did enjoy the movie but mainly because of the sheer fascination with the story, rather than the execution of this version of the story.",
