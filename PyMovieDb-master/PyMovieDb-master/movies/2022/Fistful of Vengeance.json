    "reviewBody": "I really wanted to give this a rave review, I loved the Wu Assassin TV Show but this is a pale imitation.\n\nI felt bad for scoring it so low\n\nThe story is poor, it&apos;s as if they rushed to out a movie together so that people would remember the Wu Assassin existed , they should not have bothered, the story is disjointed with no character development, characters appear with no real addition to the storyline, the bad guys wear black leather jackets with metal studs and the hood guys wear normal street clothes that&apos;s the level this is working at\n\nPoor editing and production make for a film that had potential to come across as poor and Ill-conceived, I&apos;m not if Katheryn Winnick could have rescued this?\n\nThe good points are the fight scenes with Uwais and Tan kicking but, they are well choreographed as you would expect from something with Iko Uwais starring\n\nWatch it if you like long decent choreographed martial arts sequences, just turn your brain all the way down to not caring what you watch mode and you&apos;ll be ok.",
