    "reviewBody": "This is a slow moving meditation on grief, family dysfunction and letting go of the past. Both Ewan McGregor and Ethan Hawke give heartfelt and believable performances as two estranged brothers. You have to be in the mood to watch this slice-of-life film as it does plod along. We saw the movie trailer and knew this was one of those offbeat films that probably won&apos;t attract a lot of viewers. The supporting cast is decent. Sometimes a storyline is interesting enough that you are willing to immerse yourself in that world for 2 hours. At its best, you can learn from whatever life challenges the characters are experiencing. Then when the credits roll, you are glad you put in the time to explore that world.",
