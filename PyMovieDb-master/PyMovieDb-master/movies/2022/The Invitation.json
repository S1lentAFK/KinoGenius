    "reviewBody": "That&apos;s about the most I can say about this. It was in fact something I watched.\n\nIt fails at being a horror It fails at being a romance It could&apos;ve been a passable mystery, but the trailer spoiled it.\n\nIt wasn&apos;t bombastic enough to be fun, but it wasn&apos;t well-written enough to justify its dullness.\n\nAt best it&apos;s a way to spend an evening. Although, personally, if it wasn&apos;t for the fact that I got to watch it for free (I work at a movie theater), then I would&apos;ve been dissatisfied with my purchase.",
