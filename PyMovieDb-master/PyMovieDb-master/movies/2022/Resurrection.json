    "reviewBody": "I hated it. I love Rebecca Hall and Tim Roth but I had to struggle to get through this. It&apos;s the most uncomfortable and annoying film I&apos;ve seen in recent memory. You just want to shake someone or slap em.\n\nIt&apos;s a slow burn that goes haywire somewhere and everything you thought you knew goes out the window.\n\nIt honestly gave me a migraine by the end.bWhich, I&apos;ll say nothing about but....yeesh.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal but Hall is always fantastic to watch. I can&apos;t even imagine what this film would have been with someone else cast.\n\nIt&apos;s dark, it&apos;s disturbing and really maddening. If that&apos;s up your alley, go for it. I however will not be recommending it to anyone or watching it again.",
