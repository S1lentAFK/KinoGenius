    "reviewBody": "This is a waste of star power. Kevin Bacon and Travis Kimmel can&apos;t pull off a stunt that would make the film a little likeable.\n\nThe storyline has all the makings of compelling drama centering on the relationship between estranged son and his father, and between an estranged husband and his wife and daughter. It simply lacks the gravitas to make it work. After a while, it becomes rather formulaic.\n\nThe idea of setting it on a moving bus has been done before. Remember 1994&apos;s Speed starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves? That is an example of a thriller that keeps the viewer&apos;s rapt attention all the way. With that as the standard, this film really falls short of expectations; the opportunity for a good film is squandered.",
