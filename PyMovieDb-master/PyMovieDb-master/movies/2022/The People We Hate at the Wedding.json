    "reviewBody": "This movie is one incoherent scene full of people who don&apos;t even remotely act like real people after another. Ben Platt and Kristen Bell are absolutely insufferable and made me actively angry. There&apos;s almost no explanation for how awful these characters are or why they hate their sister for no reason. This isn&apos;t an Always Sunny in Philadelphia situation where it&apos;s entertaining watching awful people do awful things, it&apos;s more so I want to rip my eyeballs out and extract the memory of this wretched pain from my brain. Also, this has some of the most egregiously disgusting product placement I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s like watching that fake Korean Subway tv show from John Oliver.\n\nThis was a truly horrible experience that I wouldn&apos;t wish on my worst enemy. Please avoid this like the plague.",
