    "reviewBody": "Causeway is a decent drama backed by great performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Brian Tyree Henry. Lila Neugebauer&apos;s debut feature is a quiet moving drama which slowly shows a soldiers recovery from a brain injury.\n\nJennifer Lawrence wisely chooses a smaller production here, taking a break from big budget affair like Hunger Games & especially X-Men (The X-Men series ended up a noose round Lawrence&apos;s neck after the great First Class & Days Of Future Past).\n\nBrian Tyree Henry continues his rise here and does well in a more serious role than usually expected from him. After Bullet Train, he&apos;s had a fairly successful year.\n\nHopefully Jennifer Lawrence will stick to more independent efforts like this and Winter&apos;s Bone as that&apos;s where her talents are definitely more suited.",
