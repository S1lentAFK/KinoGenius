    "reviewBody": "A coming of age story about a rebellious teenager who hates his parents for wanting him to go to college and be serious about his studies, when all he wants is draw cartoons and become an artist.\n\nA lot of nerds. A lot of whining parents. And a lot of frustration suffered by teenagers. We have seen it all before. Is it any good?\n\nThe good; I must say that this is an honest movie with true to life characters. It&apos;ll do as a nice coming of age portrait, BUT...\n\nThe bad: this is not a new teenager classic, because it is lacking spark and punch and the actor&apos;s aint particularly great.\n\nNot bad, not great either....",
