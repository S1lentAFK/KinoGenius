    "reviewBody": "For a concise summary of what to expect from this film I can&apos;t do better than direct you to Rooprect&apos;s review.\\n\\nWhen I saw Tree of Life I think I was fortunate in that I knew absolutely nothing about it beforehand. All I knew was the title, and I&apos;d briefly seen the enigmatic poster for it. But who was in the cast or who directed it, etc, I knew not. So I went in completely open minded. \\n\\nI also timed the cinema visit so I missed all the ads and trailers - I&apos;m not saying this necessarily improved the viewing, but the nature of the movie is at a polar opposite to all that commercial stuff, and it was good not to be distracted by that crap.\\n\\nTurned out: It really was a memorable film, and I won&apos;t forget that couple of hours in the cinema watching it, it felt like a rare treat. Very enjoyable experience, but a film completely outside the usual Hollywood fodder of an Odeon or Vue.",
