    "reviewBody": "There is no doubt that. It was almost perfect in everything. Its even one of the best movie I have ever seen. Only a few can be considered better than this (and, of course, all from Hollywood).\\n\\nI bet this movie will do great business if they manage to release to a larger audience in India, middle east, UK and USA. This should at least be nominated for Oscars. I am proud for what Shoaib Mansoor has done for lifting Pakistan&apos;s name by his movies. He is a true legend. His work for media industry has been tremendous and luckily he was awarded for his work by Sitar-e-Imtiaz, even before he made his two movies.\\n\\nNo soul in Pakistan should deprive themselves for watching this movie in theater.",
