    "reviewBody": "My wife and I were scrolling through Netflix for something to watch. We went right through Margin Call several times. A couple of times was because it was made in 2011, so a little old. The brief description was not overly attractive and the picture didn't do it justice. We finally watched it when we were semi-desperate. So wrong to over look it. If you are even marginally interested (yes a slight pun) in finance and the meltdown in 2007-2009, then you must watch it. Very underrated film, well done. If you understand finance even slightly or some of the terms used, then you can intuit some of the action. But even then, you get the jist. I loved the cast, the dialogue, the meaning of the film. Don't make the mistake we made and scroll right over it. A great watch.",
