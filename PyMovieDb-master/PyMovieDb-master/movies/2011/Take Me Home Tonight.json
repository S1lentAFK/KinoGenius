    "reviewBody": "I saw this at a screening today and I enjoyed the movie. \n\nI thought that all the leads did a good job, especially Topher Grace and Teresa Palmer. \n\nThey had some good chemistry, and Topher does a good job of playing an uncomfortable guy at times in the movie... Its fun and engaging, so you don't notice the time passing. \n\nAlso, it has an excellent 80s soundtrack, and even a message, which I won't give away so nothing is spoiled. \n\nAll in all, a good time will be had by all who go who like these kinds of movies!",
