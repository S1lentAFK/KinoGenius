    "reviewBody": "This may very well be the first film that I have watched by a Palestinian filmmaker, and it was a good one. It deals quite a bit with the oppression of the Palestinian Arabs by Israeli authorities over the years, beginning with the takeover of Palestinian territory in 1948. This follows the life of a family in Nazareth. Much of the story is told quietly and at a distance; the dialogue is minimal. That does not mean this is grim or didactic, not at all. Regular helpings of physical, stage comedy lighten what is a serious story. There are several things that went on that I did not understand - the behavior of certain characters was mystifying, and why do they sometimes speak in English? But that did not ruin things - this is a fine film overall.",
