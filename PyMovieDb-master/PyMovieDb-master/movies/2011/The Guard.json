    "reviewBody": "I must take issue with the bobbowhite review.\\n\\nAs a citizen of Ireland I can safely say that this film is easy to understand and accents should not be adjusted just so that USA folk can follow.\\n\\nIf an English MP can find the film enjoyable and recommend it to her 35,000+ twitter followers, then no-one should complain.\\n\\nThe scenery is superb.\\n\\nThe characters just right for the West of Ireland as I remember it.\\n\\nThe whole scope of the current Irish populace is contained in the film and age old attitudes subtly dealt with.",
