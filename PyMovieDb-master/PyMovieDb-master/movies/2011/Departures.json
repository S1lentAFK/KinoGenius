    "reviewBody": "This is a classic story about terminally ill teenager with a cliched bucket list. Although there is nothing novel to the plot, the cast is on point, music is refreshing and the filming locations are beautiful. Watching this won't be a life changing experience, but it won't be a waste of your time either.",
