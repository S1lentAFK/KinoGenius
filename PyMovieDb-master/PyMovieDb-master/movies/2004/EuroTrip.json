    "reviewBody": "This movie is hilarious & a must see for those who like American Pie, Scary Movie, Senseless & similar types of comedies. Eurotrip uses almost every single clich\\u00e9 or stereotype regarding Europe & exaggerates it enormously in an unbelievably funny way.\\n\\nSurprisingly the acting, which is done mainly by unknown actors & actresses, is very good. As for Michelle Trachtenberg, she is just plain awesome. Her acting deserves real praise. Plus, the film features several pretty successful cameo appearances. Lucy Lawless as S&M dominatrix is particularly hilarious.\\n\\nThough the story itself can&apos;t be considered particularly original, the movie is interesting, cause of unstoppable flow of hilarious jokes. The theater was almost torn down with the viewers&apos; laughter, when I watched the film. The scene with The Pope is an instant classic in my point of view, I haven&apos;t seen something this hilarious since the first Scary Movie came out. Some satirical aspects also take place in the movie: especially funny was the scene, when the characters arrive to a club in Slovakia & hear a techno remix of a song &apos;Scotty Doesn&apos;t Know&apos;. Awesome moment.\\n\\nIn general, I think the film is underrated. In my opinion it is better than the first & the second American Pie, the second Scary Movie & a great number of less famous comedies. Go see it & have fun.",
