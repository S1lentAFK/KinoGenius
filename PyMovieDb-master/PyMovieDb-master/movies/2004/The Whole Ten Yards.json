    "reviewBody": "Jimmy The Tulip Tudeski (Bruce Willis) is hiding in Mexico and spending his days as a homemaker. Jill (Amanda Peet) is itching to kill and can&apos;t take their lives together. Crazed mob boss Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak) has just been released from prison. He comes looking to kill the paranoid Oz Oseransky (Matthew Perry) and find where Jimmy is to avenge for killing his son Janni. Lazlo kidnaps Oz&apos;s newly pregnant wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge). Oz goes to Mexico to beg Jimmy and Jill to rescue Cynthia from Lazlo. Jimmy doesn&apos;t want to help but Lazlo comes shooting anyways.\n\nI found Kevin Pollak not funny and very annoying. It lost the very limited charm of the original. It tries so hard to be wacky that it stumbles into an unwatchable mess. Everybody is trying to out-crazy the other. More than anyone, the jittery Matthew Perry personifies the overacting that is happening here. Amanda Peet is also jittery taking a page out of Perry&apos;s playbook. Even Bruce Willis is going crazy. It&apos;s too much and worst of all it&apos;s not funny.",
