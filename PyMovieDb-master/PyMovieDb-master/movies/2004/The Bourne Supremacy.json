    "reviewBody": "Oh man, I say The Bourne Supremacy is much more thrilling than the first one. The first one was like an introduction of Bourne and now since we know the character, it is left with solid story and thrilled feeling after watching.\n\nThe story follows after the first installation; Bourne fight back after being framed by the Russian mob and now the CIA is after him.\n\nWhat can I say; this is better than Bond series, with all the actions, sophisticated car chase scenes, the cat and mouse chase and the tactic between the killing machine and the world biggest organization. The soundtrack is also great.\n\nThis is brilliant movie, somewhat surpass my expectation. I thought it is like a B grade but this is definitely an A.\n\nRecommended.\n\nRating: 8/10 (Grade: A-)",
