    "reviewBody": "SpongeBob finally made it to the big screen and the good thing is - it is nothing less of the TV series, just longer and more fun. Staring SpongeBob and Patrick in search of stolen crown of King Neptune, before he turns Mr. Crab into fried crab.\n\nIf you&apos;re a fan of the TV series this will not disappoint you at all, and if you&apos;re not a fan you will become one. Surprisingly, the movie able to bring all the characteristic and style of the show on to the big screen without trying too hard. It is still the same old SpongeBob, and that what I like about this movie.\n\nThe story is consistence and the humor is still fun to watch, there is always something new coming up making it unpredictable. And the original song is brilliantly written and somewhat quite inspiring. SpongeBob still make it big despite being a 2D cartoon cause the animation here is colorfully done.\n\nOverall: I enjoy the whole film, but maybe a little downside on the David Hasselhoff parts. But overall it is an extremely enjoyable film.\n\nReason To Watch: Finally Able To See SpongeBob In Full Length Movie. Triple The Fun.\n\nReason Not To: Dislike Real People Acting With Cartoon.\n\nRating: 7/10 (Grade: B-).\n\nPlease Rate (Y/N) After Reading, Thank You.",
