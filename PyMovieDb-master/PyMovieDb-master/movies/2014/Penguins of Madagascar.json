    "reviewBody": "Although the film wasn't really needed, it is absolutely brilliant. Benedict Cumberbatch is the best part of this movie. His acting is brilliant as always. I wouldn't mind seeing a spin-off about the origins of the North Wind, the spy agency that his character runs. It would be awesome. I was a bit hesitant that this would kill the Madagascar franchise like Shrek Forever After killed the Shrek franchise but I gave it a chance and it was great. Sorry, Pixar but I think Dreamworks will eventually knock you off the top spot as the best animation studio. I loved everything about this movie. It's perfect. Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars",
