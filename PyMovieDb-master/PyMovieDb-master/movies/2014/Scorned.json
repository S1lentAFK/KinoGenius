    "reviewBody": "I recently watched this with my girlfriend and the scenario intrigued us both as I myself like the idea of having the character you are fond of have the higher power. The hit back techniques against the people who have done unforgivable things to us where great and some bits made me giggle. Unsure why. \n\nThe script was absolutely terrible I thought. Anyone can write this. There's no significant meanings behind anything here. Surely there could of been a rewrite because I wanted to turn the film off in the first 10 minutes.\n\nAnnaLynne McCord is what the film had spot on for itself. She is outstanding and she really has a sublime career in her reach. She just needs the people to work to have more experience to adapt to her incapable emotional rollercoasters that she can portray so easily. She deserves a lot from this but the other actors have very few opportunities ahead of them. Ill give this a 5 because of AnnaLynne McCord. 5/10.",
