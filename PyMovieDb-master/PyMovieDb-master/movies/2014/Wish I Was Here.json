    "reviewBody": "Why they call it a comedy I don't know? To me a comedy is something that makes me laugh, it's about being happy, about feeling good. This movie is just a family drama, not a comedy, unless you count the odd funny thing they say every now and then. I don't say the movie is bad, it's just not my thing. If you are looking for some laughs then this movie is not for you. If you are looking for a family with a lot of drama about dying, with a lot of bull about God and religion, about actors trying to give you a life lesson and other boring stuff then this movie is definitely for you. The actors are not bad, the filming is okay, and that's about it. I watched it once and it will just stay once.",
