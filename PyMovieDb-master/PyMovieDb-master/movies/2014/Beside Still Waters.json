    "reviewBody": "This self-indulgent pile of crap might be somewhat palatable if even one of the characters were likable. I could forgive the fact that the entire plot is tired and hackneyed (see The Big Chill, Peter's Friends, St. Elmo's Fire, and about a dozen other movies that are exactly like this) if there were one character I liked or gave a damn about, but every, single character is an annoying, clawing, self-centered jerk. It's a bad sign when you can't even feel bad for the guy whose parents have just dropped dead in an accident. Every clich\u00e9 is played to the hilt in this movie. It's not remotely interesting to look at, which seems a shame, as it's set in an area which could have made for, if nothing else, really great scenery. The script feels like something a a first year film student would come up with. The acting is painfully stiff. Do yourself a favor and check out something like Your Sister's Sister or The Skeleton Twins. This one is not worth your time.",
