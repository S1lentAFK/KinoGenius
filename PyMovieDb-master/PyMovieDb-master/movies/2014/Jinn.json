    "reviewBody": "Having read a lot about the topic of Jinns, I was not completely disappointed by the movie although it could have been made even better.\n\nStory took of well and was entertaining and subject was well researched. Good job showing the 'chillah'. Have read about it in my curious readings so could make a connection.\n\nNot many could show this perspective of Jinns in mainstream cinema. It may be a new thing for all to understand the significance of the Holy Zamzam water or of the incantations.\n\nThe camera work and direction was flawless. Although at times the background score was a bit misplaced. Acting was passable too. Hopefully when the Jinn returns with a sequel (if any) it may improve to get a better viewership.\n\nGood try on this movie.",
