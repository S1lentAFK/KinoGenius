    "reviewBody": "When this movie was announced, I was honestly just going to watch because of Om Puri. However, the plot of the movie is so well written, Om Puri was just a extra bonus. This movie has humor that just comes out naturally, but it also shows lots of emotions. This movie hit me home and I am pretty sure it will hit home to others as well. The casting is very well picked and I really enjoyed this film with my family. It is one of those movies you can watch with your family, and just relax and enjoy. There were some plot holes and other things you might find odd, but the whole movie as a whole was well made. A R Rahman also never disappoints with the movie score. \\n\\nVerdict: Well Written, Well Made, Enjoyable film. For foodies and the families of anyone.",
