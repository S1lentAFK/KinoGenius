    "reviewBody": "I heard about this film because I&apos;ve been a fan of Sharlto Copley since District 9. When I saw the trailer, I was extremely interested. I wanted to watch it to find out why the hell he was in a pit of dead bodies and why he didn&apos;t have any memory of how exactly he got in that situation. The plot has many little details that give you hints as to what is going on, but when I finally pieced them together, I was surprised. It keeps you guessing as to whats really going on throughout almost the entire film. I won&apos;t ruin the reveal, but I did NOT see it coming. It&apos;s a fairly interesting and original film, and I enjoyed the ride.",
