    "reviewBody": "The Angriest Man In Brooklyn isn't the most perfect film. A slight copycat on the amazing Stranger Than Fiction, but not as gripping or funny!\n\nThat said, considering what the late great Robin Williams goes through as his character, one can only watch in sadness and with tear-filled eyes in thinking that his passionately delivered dialogue really came from the heart as a cry for help.\n\nIt is only with this unfortunate event, that you watch TAMIB with a completely different view.\n\nAs a film, it passes the time and makes you think about life. It has entertaining moments, some laughs and some great performances. Its simple and worth a watch.\n\nWe miss you Robin Williams.",
