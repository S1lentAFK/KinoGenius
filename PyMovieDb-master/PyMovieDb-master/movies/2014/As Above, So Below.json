    "reviewBody": "I wasn't expecting much to be honest, as the whole found footage genre seems to have died a death, but this is surprisingly good. It begins in dramatic fashion, and for the most part doesn't let up, anyone that suffers with claustrophobia or a feeling of being trapped will appreciate the efforts of the film, or not. Some creepy scenes, I liked the part where the phone was ringing, that was atmospheric, as well as the push deeper into the cave. Perdita Weeks was excellent in the role.\n\nThis was rather good. 7/10",
