    "reviewBody": "PPS is a homage to the 80s through and through - care has been taken with the usual wardrobe and hair, but more than that it has tried to capture something of both the mannerisms and the film style of the 80s.\\n\\nThe film has both a John Hughes&apos; summer of coming of age vibe and even a touch of Napolean Dynamite in the family&apos;s relatives. It also pays more than a nod to the Eighties style of sports&apos; movies, here through a ping pong game against the local bully rich kid.\\n\\nAll in all, this has more style than substance, but it well put together with an excellent cast. It will appeal ti a wide audience of those who remember the Eighties and to those who like the idea of the Eighties. It&apos;s a fun watch and a good film to share with friends.",
