Sequel to \\u00a8The mechanic\\u00a8 by Simon West , at the same time a remake from classic film directed by Michael Winner (1972) that was starred by Charles Bronson with screenplay by Lewis John Carlino .

Bishop will have no other choice but to agree in carrying out three dangerous suicide assignments across the four corners in the world . As his last assignment for an old colleague results to be the killing three important business men . But Bishop is caught in the middle of treason and threat .\\n\\nThis crime thriller packs intrigue, suspense, noisy action-packed with grisly killings ,explosive excitement, thrills and lots of violence . This moving film is as calculating , cold and passionless as its central characters , two brutal enemies . Jason Statham with his usual hard acting displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives . It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Statham's side in spite of being a cruel killer . Statham as a wealthy murderer for a powerful magnate offers the sort of strong acting as always. Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast such as Jessica Alba as Bishop's love interest, but the romance isn't what this movie offers , it is about action and violence and director knows his work , as well as Sam Hazeldine , Michelle Yeoh , John Cenatiempo and special mention for veteran Tommy Lee Jones in a brief appearance as the millionaire Max Adams . \\n\\n It packs stirring musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Mark Isham . Colorful cinematography by Daniel Gottschalk with spectacular scenes filmed in several locations in Phuket, Thailand , Bangkok, Thailand , Penang, Malaysia , Sofia, Bulgaria ,Varna, Bulgaria , Buzludzha Mountain, Central Balkan Mountains, Balkan Mountains, Bulgaria Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, (Sugarloaf Mountain) ,Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney Opera House , Macquarie Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia . This big hit motion picture was professionally directed by Dennis Gansel though with no originality , being a simple and plain vehicle for a big star : Jason Statham . German filmmaker Gansel has directed a few but successful films such as : The wave , Napola , We Are the Night and Berlin I love you . The director Dennis Gansel 's well-oiled techniques generate some explosive entertainment and excitement,as usual . This is an acceptable film about a deadly rivalry among killers , thrilling kidnapping and restless rescue that will appeal to Jason Statham fans and action lovers .",
