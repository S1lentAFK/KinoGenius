    "reviewBody": "Unusual, interesting film that doesn&apos;t fully succeed to be what it is until it ends. That finale causes everything that occurred earlier to make sense, but this will be a slow go for those seeking more immediate answers to the puzzling behavior of the lead character, excellently portrayed by Tim Roth. The entire cast is fine, but it is his show. Ultimately, a touching, intriguing film for the patient.",
