    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve made it to this third movie of the series Trolls , at the cinema, with my two little cousins.\n\nIt made them happy to be there, and the movie felt really wholesome with fun little moments.\n\nPersonally, I have watched the first and the second movies and I liked them both. What made, this one, more special than the last two, was the moment in time it was released, for me, thus have been given a special conotation.\n\nPlus, little cousins felt really well, I&apos;ve made it and bought them some safe souvenirs with Trolls, and those souvenirs were about little loving sisters, and them were in really close connection to Poppy and Viva themselves.\n\nHad a good time!\n\n8/10.",
