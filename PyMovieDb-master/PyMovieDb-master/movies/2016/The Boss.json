I am money worshipper (just kidding), love baby boss&apos;s expensive suit and watch, love all money throwing, and handle things with tickets.\n\nThe mature voice of baby boss and his baby body full of millions of stark contrasts! Just like the little gangsta fox from Zootopia. Also the ending screen is so cute, new baby boss coming!",
