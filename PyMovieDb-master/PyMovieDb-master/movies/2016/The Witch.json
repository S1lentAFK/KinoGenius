    "reviewBody": "The Witch is just a great horror film. I loved so much about it. It has a great creepy feel to it, a dark evil vibe mixed in, and a touch of urban legend sprinkled on top.\n\nThe film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film. It&apos;s also a brilliant display of female empowerment, which is common among horror films, but in a whole new way that&apos;s different from the standard last surviving girl motif.\n\nWhether you&apos;re a fan of horror, or just great films in general... I highly suggest The Witch to everyone.\n\nA very strong and deserving 8 out of 10!",
