    "reviewBody": "This is my favorite CBM of all time. It&apos;s brilliant. I honestly think the world wasn&apos;t ready for it when it first came out. As with most of Zack Snyder&apos;s projects, it was ahead of its time. I only wish THIS version was released in theaters. WB butchered 30 minutes of important plot and character development out of this movie for the theatrical cut. This is so much better.",
