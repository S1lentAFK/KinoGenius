    "reviewBody": "The Benefactor is a small drama with a decent cast. Sometimes these kind of movies are really engrossing but unfortunately this one although not terrible isn&apos;t memorable. \n\nRichard Gere plays a Philanthropist haunted by the death of his friends and wanting to relive his past and make amends at the same time. He therefore sets out to help his friends daughter and her new husband. Although Gere is a good actor his character in this film just comes across as unlikeable. This therefore stops any sympathy you have for him and effectively ends much interest in the film. I thought Theo James did a good job as the husband but Dakota Fanning is woefully under used. \n\nAt times this is mildly interesting so it wasn&apos;t a complete write off but towards the end it sags badly and the rushed ending is highly unsatisfactory. \n\nUnless you&apos;re a huge fan of any of the actors I&apos;d give this one a skip. This probably worth a 5 but I&apos;ll up it to a 6 just for the shock scene near the start.",
