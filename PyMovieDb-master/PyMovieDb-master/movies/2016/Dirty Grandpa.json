    "reviewBody": "Just saw Dirty Grandpa with a theater full of 60- and 70-somethings (myself included). Appropriately, it was a 10:50 a.m. showing. I can tell you that everyone - my wife and 86-yr-old father-in-law included - were howling at this thing. Sure it was over-the-top gross, but it was also very, very funny. The final scene between Aubrey Plaza and DeNiro had me laughing so hard I had tears running down my cheeks. I can't believe all of the god-awful reviews I'm reading for this movie. I have to admit that I love Aubrey Plaza, so watching her interact with DeNiro was a real treat (and consistently funny). Zac Efron was solid as the grandson ... and had to have been an incredibly good sport to put up with all he had to in his role. I say, if you're over 60 and not offended by raunchy humor, give this movie a chance. I thought it was great!",
