    "reviewBody": "I went into this movie with high expectations, but alas, I was let down. Good actors and a plausible story, but inevitably Triple 9 fails to deliver. There are no characters I could really root for with the possible exception of Casey Affleck (just a little). I found myself yawning several times throughout - it just didn&apos;t hold my interest. No real back story so it&apos;s hard to fathom what these characters are really all about. Some sexy girls, guys with tattoos and attitude and bad cops. The bank robbery at the beginning was the most exciting part and it&apos;s downhill from there. Somehow I didn&apos;t buy Kate Winslet as a badass. The best line in the film was Woody Harrelson&apos;s reference to the Kosher Nostra - that actually got a few laughs. Don&apos;t say you weren&apos;t warned.",
