    "reviewBody": "Well, I enjoyed this movie to the point I would watch it again to catch some of the nuances you miss during first viewing. The story is a bit complicated with several couples in overlapping relationships, but that makes it interesting. The actors are all good with real responses to the surprise events. Unveiling the main character&apos;s, Rachel, story in drunken snippets adds to the tension. Some other reviewers complain about plot points that don&apos;t make sense but, in some cases, it&apos;s because the reviewer did not understand the plot and the inter-relationships of the characters. Special credit to Emily Blunt and Haley Bennet for portraying the angst in their personal situations.",
