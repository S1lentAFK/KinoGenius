    "reviewBody": "This is one of the most near-perfect movies that I have watched in a very long time. I was completely enthralled with the storyline, the actors, and the movie itself. The movie had it all, comedy, drama, and guidance on the angsts of growing up and being a teen. I could not have asked for a more complete movie. Very good, very, very good.",
