    "reviewBody": "An excellent story about a dirty cop for a neighbor and Patrick Wilson's character not being able to do much about it. Great that it's not the type to contrive racist things all over it instead it's more subtle. I love how the movie gets away with 2 f bombs! Lakeview Terrace is under appreciated and highly entertaining in my opinion; deserves more credit!",
