    "reviewBody": "I love Jane Lynch and Paul Rudd. The cast is great even if the film has some issues. Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd played business partners who end up serving community service as the Sturdy Wings big brothers in Jane Lynch&apos;s center. The film has some moments but it&apos;s really entertaining if you don&apos;t wanted to think too much. Despite having kids in the movie, this film is not for children.",
