    "reviewBody": "Max Payne was a game that was born of Film Noir and John Woo. This movie? Voice overs = 1 or two. (There was hope in the opening but then nothing) Action scenes = minimal. (Not too bad other than being sparse) Acting = very good for what little the script offers. (The actors do not deserve the blame for this atrocity unless it is for choosing to do this script.) Scenery/Cinematography = Brilliant but wasted on scenes like 8 minutes picking up a folder with no conflict in the scene. (The scenery was impressively accurate to the game. I kept feeling like it was going to get better because of it. Then nothing would happen.)\\n\\nI wanted this to be good. I kept lying to myself and saying it would get better any minute.\\n\\nPeople who say I am disappointed because it isn&apos;t the video game need to understand I didn&apos;t want the video game I wanted an action film that captured the essence of the game.\\n\\nWe are left with no reason to care for Max Payne. If I was the writer I would have been ashamed to have my name attached.\\n\\nMax Payne got the Indy treatment.\\n\\nI really want my money back on this one. I felt insulted that they thought this script was a passable story.",
