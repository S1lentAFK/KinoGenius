    "reviewBody": "Steven Spielburg is just hitting out blockbusters 3 times a year at least at the moment and this outing is definitely not different. The film is exciting, well acted and has been well thought out and directed.\n\nThe film is about a slacker who gets drawn into a government scandal by a mysterious voice on a cell phone along with the mother of a young child who is performing at the white house and they eventual find themselves running from not only the machine, but the whole country of America as well. This leads to a very good movie I would definitely recommend to any movie goer.\n\nAnyway, Shia Labeouf is very good in this film and helps hold it together with Billy Bob Thornten, who, I must admit actually did a good job in this film.\n\nOverall, I think this film is a good watch and a good movie to watch with friends. It really does show that Steve is one of the masters of Hollywood. I rate it 74%",
