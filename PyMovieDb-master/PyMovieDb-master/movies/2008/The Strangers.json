    "reviewBody": "It would be so easy to dismiss the very deliberate pacing of this film as pedestrian, but in this day and age of gratuitous violence and constant gore, this film relies on the ability to slowly torment you, as toy watch the hideous way in which the young couple are subjected to the night from Hell.\\n\\nAt the time I genuinely did find this a very unsettling, unnerving watch, going home to an empty house after this was unsettling.\\n\\nIgnore those that call it boring, trust me, it isn&apos;t, it&apos;s paced in a way that throws you off guard.\\n\\nNo clear begining, or end, just a series of random events. It&apos;s a grim movie. 7/10",
