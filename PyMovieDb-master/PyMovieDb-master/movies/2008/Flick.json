    "reviewBody": "I really didn't expect to enjoy this film, but I love to be wrong.\n\nThis movie follows Johnny, the scorned lover finally exhumed from the bottom of the lake, forty years after he slaughtered dozens at a high school dance. Now he is back to find his girl and take revenge. A Memphis detective joins a British flatfoot in the hunt to save the girl and kill the bad guy.\n\nThe film is very stylized, so if you don't like that don't watch it. And the sound track is fantastic. I love Rockabilly! The characters are over the top, archetypal (just like a comic book) but it is very evident that this is the intention of the director from the comic style of the film.\n\nDefinitely not a high budget film for the masses but a must see for anyone who loves rockabilly and rockabilly themes, or fans of the genre.\n\nI keep seeing this listed as a comedy. There really no reason for that. You have the occasional comedic relief, but genre wise really its more of a surrealistic zombie horror.\n\nAnyway, make some popcorn and watch the movie.",
