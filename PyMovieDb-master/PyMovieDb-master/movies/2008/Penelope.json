    "reviewBody": "I saw this movie last year at a screening, but it has taken me awhile to submit a comment on here.\n\nI LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! It is a wonderful story with a great message that needs to be heard in this modern age. \n\nI assume it will be targeted toward teens, but as a 36 year old, I really enjoyed it. It might be one of Ricci's best performances, as good as Black Snake Moan, but completely different roles. James McAvoy is charming. Catherine Ohara, Reese Witherspoon and Peter Dinklage are nice surprises and always funny when they appear. Overall, very enjoyable. It is somewhat predictable, but it has to have a happy ending.",
