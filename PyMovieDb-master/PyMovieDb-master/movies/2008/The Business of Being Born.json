    "reviewBody": "The Business is awesome. About as cool as the punk rock band the Business.\n\nWhen the movie starts you wonder if the film quality and information in the film is worth it, I mean, it is a documentary. As the film goes on it gets better and better.\n\nEven though I'm not sure if I agree with this film 100% (I haven't had time or necessity to research) I learned a monstrous amount of information and was blown away by how much I didn't know. B.O.B.B. OPENS UP YOUR EYES!\n\nThe best part was seeing women barely go through pain, though as the film goes on you do see more and more pain, but it does seem less in some ways than in the hospital.\n\nI would have liked to know more about the dangers of death but they did touch on this mildly.",
