    "reviewBody": "Bonneville is a movie that is more like what Hollywood used to make for films. A movie with a real believable story and not all a bunch of digitized magic. Finally a movie where the actors can act like real people we can all relate to in our own lives. \\n\\nLange,Bates and Allan did a wonderful job of portraying three Mormon friends rebelling against her step daughters wishes to fulfill her late husbands desires. A wonderful film with feeling and happiness. Should be more like this..\\n\\nChristopher Rowley did a wonderful job of directing this cast in a heart felt film. Drop of Water productions should go along way in the future.",
