    "reviewBody": "This movie was amazing and the fact that the story was true brings me pure joy. It is in fact a painfull movie beacause the story is so relatable and real. The friendshipp the this trio is present in every scene and the way they lean on each other until the end makes you believe that you can rely on your best friend in your darkest times.\n\nTo the cast, i give an great performance. i have to guive a shout out to Jason Segel for is performance. normally i see him in great comedies but is always good to see him go in other directions .\n\nThe director was great and the screenpaly was well writen.",
