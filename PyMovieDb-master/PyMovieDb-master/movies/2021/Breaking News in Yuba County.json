    "heading": "Amusing black comedy that often recalls the Cohen Brothers&apos; twisted storytelling",
    "reviewBody": "Crafting a tangled plot that weaves together it&apos;s deplorable characters through lies and misunderstandings. Allison Janney delivers a standout performance as the lead, impressively straddling the line between being sympathetic and morally reprehensible. It may come up a bit short on actual laughs, but it&apos;s inventive story is fun to watch play out. I can&apos;t for the life of me understand why other reviews of this are so low.",
