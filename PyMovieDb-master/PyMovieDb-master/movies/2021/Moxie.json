    "reviewBody": "Well acted, well directed, and was able to show true intersectional feminism in the many complicating forms that it deserves.\n\nThe soundtrack is killer and it covers so many topics at the surface level that may excite the audience to dig in deeper with some of these topics. Definitely a movie for now, and if you&apos;re interested in watching a movie that tackles these issues in a well produced, highly entertaining, and informative then I would highly recommend this one.",
