    "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this as potentially a new beginning for the franchise. Unfortunately, poor writing and a lack of depth really let it down. The pacing was off and though Rock was ok, his lack of real acting chops showed. It&apos;s worth a look but don&apos;t expect anything special.",
