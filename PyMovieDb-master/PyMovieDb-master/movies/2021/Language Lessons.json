    "reviewBody": "Fresh. I like when I find hidden gems like this. Good writing and acting. Very pleased to see that Natalie Morales directed this. I saw in the comments that some of you are not familiar with the actor who plays Adam, Mark Duplass, I watched him on the tv show called Togetherness, and remembered him very well. Such a funny show and cast. Also, the concept and the vibe of this movie reminded me of the movie 10 000km. Check that one.",
