    "reviewBody": "Have you ever made a recipe that, when you read the list of ingredients you think, wow, I like all of those, that should work together really well. So you make it following the directions and sit down to eat and something is just missing?\n\nThat&apos;s Queen Bees. Given the list of very accomplished stars, the premise, the trailer, everything should work together really well. But it doesn&apos;t. In fact, it fails... just short of miserably.\n\nThe Rom was cringeworthy. The Com was virtually non-existent. The plot twist was predictable from the very first line uttered by the character.\n\nSo sad because the recipe looked so good.",
