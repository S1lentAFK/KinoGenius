    "reviewBody": "The World To Come: Life was bleak and hard in 1856 in Upstate New York, rocky fields, sheep, (could be Connemara), chickens. Life was lonely for women, but here a relationship develops between two women which goes beyond friendship. Tragedy results but the unfolding of the narrative is moving. A tale of love, separation, hardship, patriarchy and it&apos;s discontents. Directed by Mona Fastvold from a Screenplay by Ron Hansen and Jim Shepard. 8/10.",
