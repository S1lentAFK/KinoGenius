    "reviewBody": "Not really sure why this movie got so much hate. It&apos;s introducing a swath of new superhero&apos;s and doesn&apos;t really converge with any other Avengers plot lines save for a few mentions of Thanos, Thor and some other hero&apos;s. That job on its own isn&apos;t an easy one and I think they did a fantastic job of giving us a new storyline. The shear scale of the movie was well done both in terms of time periods and in general how epic and massive everything felt. Loved the diversity of the characters - every one of them added something to the story. With that being said - and this is coming from just your average Marvel fan with no knowledge of the comics - the Eternals powers all seemed a bit underwhelming. Maybe it&apos;s just that they were trying to display how powerful the deviants were but even Ikaris couldn&apos;t take down one on his own. Other than that the movie was absolutely beautifully shot - maybe the best looking Marvel movie to date. Again, I&apos;m not sure what the hate is about but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.",
