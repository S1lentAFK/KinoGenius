    "reviewBody": "People can have many perspectives until the problem becomes their own. From that point on reactions take identical approaches. So we can&apos;t judge the entrapped.\n\nWho is strong enough to stand against the colossus of states. Should we question? Is keeping secrets truly the loyalty? Isn&apos;t revelations of truth a way to express true strength and greatness of a nation?\n\nThis is not a regular one-sided documentary but rather a spectacle of colliding theories and information chess game between govt and DeHart family.\n\nJustice is a inevitable either by law or nature.",
