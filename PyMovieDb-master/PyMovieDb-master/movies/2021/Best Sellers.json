    "reviewBody": "I just finished watching the latest Michael Caine film, Best Sellers. This film is awesome. It is about a book publisher who gets a well known author, played by Michael Caine, who only published one book forty years before and get him to allow her to publish his next one and take him on a book tour.\n\nThis was an amusing film and Michael Caine gives a stellar performance as the crotchety, and nasty author. This is a wonderful film that reminds me of the performances of Al Pachino in Scent of a Woman or Jack Nicholson in As Good as it Gets. I highly recommend this film.",
