    "reviewBody": "We need more movies like this one, and far less of all the negative &apos;whoopie, we&apos;re all terrible people, so let&apos;s all get killed&apos; junk Hollywood is so fond of these days. I read many of the negative reviews before I watched this film, one the entire family could enjoy, and that&apos;s what moved this movie to the top of my &apos;watch this next&apos; list. Glad I did. Well written, acted, directed, and with an outstanding soundtrack.\n\nNo token characters, so if you&apos;re expecting to find an LGBT character, or a minority where one wouldn&apos;t normally expect one to be present, or a car chase, explosion, shoot-out, bad cops, or any of the other Hollywood tropes we&apos;re seeing elsewhere, or anything else coming off the assembly line.\n\nThis is a fine mix of established veteran actors and new young fresh faces presenting a story that has a great deal of depth. If you don&apos;t come away feeling good about the world after this one, go find yourself a mental health expert. You&apos;re clinically depressed, and in need of help.\n\nMore of this, please.",
