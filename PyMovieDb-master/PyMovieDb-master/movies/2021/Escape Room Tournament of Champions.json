    "reviewBody": "I enjoyed the first part n it has some cool traps, cool settings n the cinematography is top notch.\n\nThis one is not at par but still a good thriller.\n\nWhile the first one has suspense n is tension filled, this one gets a bit predictable, specially the fate of the priest. I knew it that he will be shown as a selfless guy and his fate will be via a selfless act.\n\nLogan Miller&apos;s character&apos;s fate is also predictable.\n\nHolland Roden looked attractive with her eye makeup.\n\nShe is there in Follow Me aka No Escape, a bit similar take on the escape room genre but with a solid twist.\n\nWhereas Taylor Russell looked weird with her makeup at the airport scene.",
