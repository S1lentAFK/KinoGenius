    "reviewBody": "I thought this movie was such a wonderful love story. I had not ever heard of Ken Wilber before, but am very interested in the topic he has written about. I want to read The Spectrum of Consciousness and his other books (he&apos;s written more than 20). I think it was no mistake a free Showtime weekend landed me on this movie, to help me along my spiritual journey. I have not seen a good movie like this that makes me cry and remind me that it is possible to fine a love like no other. My Mom got treatment for throat cancer this year and it really touched me. My Mom did survive her Stage III cancer at 85 yrs old receiving radiation and chemos. This movie was a reminder life so previously and delicate.",
