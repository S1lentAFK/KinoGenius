    "reviewBody": "So I&apos;m a big fan of horror/disaster movies and I always get a kick out of the deaths/mayhem. This was the first movie I&apos;ve ever seen where I was genuinely wishing for the mayhem to stop. And not because it was gratuitous or got tired, but because something about this movie felt very authentic and relatable. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time praying for the next death not to come because these kids felt real and I didn&apos;t want their story to end. Although the premise is obviously ridiculous, the characters in the movie take it seriously which is such a breath of fresh air from all the movies that know they are movies and make the dialogue consist of nothing more than snappy repartee and quotable sound bites even in the face of despair. Which is not to say there isn&apos;t any witty dialogue, in fact it has some of my favorite lines I&apos;ve heard in movies, but they all feel well placed and authentic. These characters just feel genuine and so you as the viewer can&apos;t help but sympathize with them and feel the same sense of dread over their potential demise.\n\nOverall, this a very unique movie that I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to recommend.",
