    "reviewBody": "Summerland is an easy to watch enjoyable movie. Nothing too difficult, just a simple story with a good outcome. The kind of movie where the characters get your attention and compassion. Gemma Arterton did a good job playing her character and as for the kids, Lucas Bond and Dixie Egerickx certainly were not annoying to watch. They all delivered here which is not always obvious with child actors. The story is well written, not a fast pace but certainly interesting to watch and the ending was a bit surprising but in a good way. Definitely worth a watch.",
