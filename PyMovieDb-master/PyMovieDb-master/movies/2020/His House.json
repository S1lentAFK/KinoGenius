    "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re a fan of in-your-face horror, this film is deeply psychological and not for you. Although politics lay the foundation for the story, the story itself isn&apos;t really about immigration. I think sometimes people see minorities in horror films and automatically think it&apos;s about racism or prejudice. To be blunt, there&apos;s no political message in film. It&apos;s well crafted and allows you to draw your own opinions. See it for yourself.",
