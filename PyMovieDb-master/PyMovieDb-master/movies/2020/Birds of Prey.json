    "reviewBody": "Margot Robbie is the perfect Harley Quinn. Over all BOP was super fun. Great action and great music. Rosie Perez is meh at best. Ewan kills it per usual. I love that they made an R rated comic book film. DC has the balls to do it knowing it won&apos;t make as much $$$ which is probably why this is one of the better comic movies to come out in a while. 7/10ðŸ–¤",
