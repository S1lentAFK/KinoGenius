    "reviewBody": "Mad scientist is also an abusive stalker. Starting when Cecelia gets away from the abusive stalker, she nonetheless continues to be impacted by the echoes of the emotional abuse. But these aren&apos;t echoes. Elizabeth Moss does well to turn the woman of domestic violence into one of psychological breakdown. She keeps the movie engaging. Whannell manages the direction of this film well (he also wrote the story and screenplay). He frames shots expertly to give empty space a personality. Worth the rental.",
