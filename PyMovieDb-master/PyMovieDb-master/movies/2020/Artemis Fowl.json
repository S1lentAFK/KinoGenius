    "reviewBody": "Before I watch this movie I had heard people say it was pretty bad but I knew it was based on a book so I thought people may have hated it because it didn&apos;t live up to it. This isn&apos;t the case it is just a bad movie.\n\nIt is so boring and like aimless. To top that off it is also really nonsensical and confusing. I don&apos;t feel like I watched the movie because I couldn&apos;t tell you anything about it, it&apos;s just like a blur.\n\nThe acting was pretty bad and I don&apos;t know why but when I was watching it I just got this like early 2000s vibe from it and I don&apos;t know why. Like I think this would have done better if it was made then. It just had that type of feel.\n\nThe writing was also pretty bad too. It is never good when a movie doesn&apos;t make you want to read the book it&apos;s based on.\n\nSo skip it it&apos;s pretty bad",
