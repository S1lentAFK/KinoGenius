    "reviewBody": "I was so excited that a new Spike Lee movie was out and wanted to like it so badly, but at the end of the day, this movie is just bad. The plotline becomes as advanced as a Disney movie (but with more blood and gore) and some of the casting choices were absolutely awful. It was disjointed and the quality overall would be expected of an amateur, but not someone like Spike Lee. I still gave it 3 stars for its display of several mental issues that veterans suffer from, but I wouldn&apos;t spend the time watching this one.",
