    "reviewBody": "Number one in the UK, the number of times I&apos;ve fallen for that one. Project Power is not going to be a film that will live you for days, you won&apos;t want to buy it on blu ray or collect memorabilia. However, if you want almost two hours of pretty well made nonsense, then you may just enjoy this, I&apos;m not a huge lover of this particular genre, so perhaps I&apos;m not the best judge, but I didn&apos;t switch it off, or skip through it, so that&apos;s a positive.\n\nThe story is very much x men territory, with some modern day drug problems thrown into the mix, Jamie Foxx is good value as always.\n\nIt is entertaining enough, but has b movie vibes, 6/10.",
