    "reviewBody": "Javier Bardem gives a terrific performance of a dementia patient, and Elle Fanning is really good as a daughter trying super hard to cope. It is a heart wrenching story, but the diversions are just very distracting. The subplot with Selma Hayek is just very confusing, I don&apos;t even know if it is a flashback or an alternate reality in the man&apos;s mind. Then the scenes involving the sea are confusing, and out of place as well. I don&apos;t really understand these parallel subplots.",
