    "reviewBody": "This was not fantastic but there are a few points that are important to point out:\n\n1) It does say it&apos;s for ages 8+. A demanding 35+ year old person will definitely find this schmaltzy.\n\n2) It focuses on being &apos;positive&apos;. I&apos;m not sure why you people are so upset about the movie. They&apos;re fine.\n\n3) They don&apos;t explain much and the characters go along with things pretty easily. I&apos;d say they don&apos;t bother to explain because they&apos;d rather focus on the kids bonding.\n\nI mean, what do people expect? The box alone suggests exactly what you&apos;re getting. If you don&apos;t want painfully sweet positivity and predictability, you should&apos;ve stuck to something else.",
