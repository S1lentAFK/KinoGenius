    "reviewBody": "It&apos;s a very interesting story, which develops well. Bart is a fascinating character, who&apos;s motives for doing what he does are sincere and innocent in his own way, buy invasive and voyeuristic.\n\nThe ending should have been so much better, if anything I thought it spoiled what was otherwise a very good film, the story builds and develops gradually, but the ending was harsh and abrupt.\n\nAlways great to see Helen Hunt, but the star of the show is of course Tye Sheridan, who&apos;s performance is actually captivating, what an amazingly talented young man he is. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll be seeing a lot of him in the future.\n\nBoy oh boy this was good, 7/10.",
