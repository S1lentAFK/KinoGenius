    "reviewBody": "We watched this movie with our kids, who are three and seven. We all really enjoyed the movie and laughed a lot. My seven-year-old was absolutely fascinated with the magic tricks! When he really liked something, he clapped like we were at a live show. It was nice to watch a non-animated, family-friendly, and not too childish movie together. There are adult elements of understanding, but it&apos;s not too heavy that the kids lose interest. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants something light, silly, and just entertaining.",
