    "reviewBody": "Terminator was not the only film whose sequel was better, I loved Killer Queen more than the previous film.\n\nSo, McG is back with his satanic cult gang, with a bang. The pure sequel, good storyline, entertaining, crazier, stupid, and Jenna Ortega is so pretty that I&apos;m in love with her.\n\nAnd you guys were missing Samara Weaving right? Go watch the film.",
