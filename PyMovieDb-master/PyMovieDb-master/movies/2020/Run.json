    "reviewBody": "&apos;Run&apos; is a well crafted, tense thriller that hits you with shocking twist upon shocking twist.\n\nWhat happens when you suddenly don&apos;t trust your mom anymore, after she has lovingly taken care of you for 17 years? &apos;Run&apos; explores this - with nail-biting suspense! This was creepy on a completely different level. The film&apos;s protagonist is Chloe, a paraplegic (excellently portrayed by real-life wheelchair bound actress Kiera Allen). Whenever a thriller features a character with a disability (or pregnant woman) the suspense is automatically elevated. &apos;Run&apos; became more intense and suspenseful with every scene.\n\nOnce the characters are set up, it doesn&apos;t take long before events take a turn for the worse, and Chloe realizes she&apos;s a prisoner within the confines of her own home. I don&apos;t want to do any spoilers, so I&apos;m not going to delve too deep into the story. This is one of those movies where the ending couldn&apos;t come soon enough. Not because I didn&apos;t like it, but because it was so nerve wrecking that I could hardly contain my curiosity to see how it would end. Amazingly, the film simply never loses momentum. This is a rather disturbing psychological thriller, and one of the must-see films of 2020 (if you&apos;re into thrillers).\n\nKiera Allan brilliantly carries the film, and Sarah Paulsen is superb as the mother, Diane. I thought &apos;Run&apos; was excellent.\n\nWould I watch it again? Yes.",
