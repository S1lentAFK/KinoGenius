    "reviewBody": "If I think back the last 10 years, Liam Neeson movies never disappointed me, which also is true to this one.\n\nCritics said, there is less action and more of the usual stuff, and in a kind of way that is right, there is less action than in the usual Liam movies (but the action there is, is excellent), but this one is more story-ridden; so this is a movie for action fans that have a bit matured like Liam, and the story is quite good and makes up for less action.\n\nSo this movie may be not so special, but one of the 1st ones in corona times that is really entertaining, you might say a popcorn movie we had in the old days and not anymore, and it is totally underrated. Enjoy!\n\n(Rating should be 7 -7.5, so I gave it 8)",
