    "reviewBody": "I am not sure why some people rated this movie below 7 but I really enjoyed it. I was thoroughly entertained because I felt the connection with the characters. Tom has the ability to make the viewers connected to the characters regardless of what role he is playing in a movie as he had done very nicely here in the News of the World. If you are a fan of Hanks, it&apos;s worth checking it out...it was worth my time/money...a good recommend and a solid 7 stars.",
