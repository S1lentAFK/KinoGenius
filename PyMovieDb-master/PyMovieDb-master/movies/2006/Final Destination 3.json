    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not gonna lie to ya, i wasn&apos;t looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .\\n\\nSo you can imagine my surprise to find that final destination 3 is a entertaining , funny and shocking thriller that proves that horror sequels can be pretty darn good if handled properly .\\n\\nDirected by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running ,the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast,packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights .\\n\\nThe film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness.But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn&apos;t a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone , but its a very good one !\\n\\nFinal destination 3 is gory ,homourous and clever fun that will make me think twice about my horror sequel prejudice....",
