    "reviewBody": "I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this movie. \n\nYes the plot has been done many times before. As with most romantic comedies, it's nothing deep, had some cheesy moments and was totally predictable (I figured out the whole movie in the first 10 minutes). \n\nBut I really enjoyed it all the same. I laughed a lot in this movie. Partly because I could totally relate to trying to live life under the radar as woman that doesn't look like a model. Plus it was refreshing to see an African American woman shown with some depth in a movie. Not just the mean black woman.\n\nThere was very little cussing, little sexuality, and no nudity. Truly refreshing these days. \n\nIf you just want to enjoy a movie without having to put too much thought into it, go see this movie.",
