    "reviewBody": "Look, let's be serious. The movie is flashy and fantastic, buried in cgi and special effects, and the plot is rather obscure and strange. What makes the movie good is that it does go over the top. This movie dazzles.\n\nIf Mila catches your eye, this movie may be the finest piece that she did around this time. So beautiful.",
