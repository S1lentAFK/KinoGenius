    "reviewBody": "EH was a simple, emotional, sports, fantasy movie about a child in the 1930's and his hookey pookey baseball and Babe Ruth.\n\nIf you like baseball and literally and thought Babe Ruth was a god then you might like this movie. I liked it, but it wasn't the best of movies. The movie lacked a better mission to care about. I just don't care about these hookey pookey baseball games. This child risked his life for a damn game. Movies like these can really be toxic to young viewers.\n\nThis was an ok movie. Children may last a good 45 minutes watching it before they realize the main purpose of the movie is dull.",
