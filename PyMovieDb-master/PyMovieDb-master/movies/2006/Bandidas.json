    "reviewBody": "BANDIDAS may not set new standards for film-making, whether those standards are for westerns, comedies, action flicks, or slapstick, but it is just as awful lot of fun to watch! The script by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen is pretty shallow and at times borders on maudlin, but it is also peppered with some little one-liners that allow the stars to show off their comedic talents.\\n\\nDirectors Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg are neophytes and wisely allow the star qualities of Salma Hayek and Pen\\u00e9lope Cruz to reign and have a good time both as opposites (Hayak comes from money and education and Cruz comes from the farm) and as partners is bank robbing - done of course in the Robin Hood manner. The bad guy is the reliable Dwight Yoakim and the fall guy is the always lively Steve Zahn. The quasi-good guy who trains the divas to be robbers is portrayed by Sam Shepard. And that is about all the viewer needs to know to realize the movie is in good hands.\\n\\nNo, the story isn&apos;t particularly &apos; find themselves - dividing their concentration between settling evil vendettas and vying for best kisser role with Steve Zahn. This is a comedy, folks, and a good lighthearted outing for two of our best actresses. Worth an evening&apos;s viewing! Grady Harp",
