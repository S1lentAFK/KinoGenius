    "reviewBody": "Look behind the woeful accent and this is actually a good movie. The first F&F was about racing, then went all Miami Vice. A final return to the street racing scene had to move away from the original cast as they had lost their 'From the streets' appeal.\n\nAnyway back to this, some sweet cars that aren't the massively expensive hyper cars of later episodes and some trick driving to boot.\n\nA quality film if you manage to watch it a couple of times and don't dwell on the accent.",
