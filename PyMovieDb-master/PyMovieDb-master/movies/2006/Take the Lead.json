    "reviewBody": "There are so many good films being released and so many formulaic films like these are released that it seems like we can do without a film like TAKE THE LEAD.But guess what,this ain&apos;t your average coming-of-age inspiring story.This is rather more fun and effective drama powered by fantastic dance sequences,with the aid of Benderas who leads the kids.\\n\\nThe entire film depends on Benderas&apos; energy and wit.He fills the film with energy and wit and excites everyone in the film.I really enjoyed the superbly choreographed dance sequences as it brings about different cultures together and shows how much fun it could be.It&apos;s really enthralling.\\n\\nA finely made entertaining film with a different treatment to an old formula.Surprise is on their side.",
