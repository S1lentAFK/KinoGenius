    "reviewBody": "I have to admit that I am somewhat biased about this film. I have an incurable form of leukemia and I found this film so touching. Everyone deals with this stuff differently and I really resounded with how the 2 leads dealt with this part of their life. The film was appropriately funny in spots and at the same time, dealt honestly with the other side of that coin. Well done. Great casting, chemistry and writing.",
