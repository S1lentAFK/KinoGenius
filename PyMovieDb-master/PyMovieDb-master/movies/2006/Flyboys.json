    "reviewBody": "Do not expect much from the plot as you need not scratch the surface too deeply to experience de&apos;ja vu. (I&apos;ve seen these plot elements before in just about every war/buddy/love story flick I have ever seen). \\n\\nThe acting is decent and the special effects are superb. Do not see this movie with high expectations regarding the plot and you will not be disappointed. \\n\\nThe effects wizards took a page from Howard Hughes as there are plenty of clouds in the air combat scenes to lend a feeling of depth and speed. The dog fights are pretty exciting and worth the price of admission to see on the big screen.",
