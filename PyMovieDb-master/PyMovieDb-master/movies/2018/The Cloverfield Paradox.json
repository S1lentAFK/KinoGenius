    "reviewBody": "Well, about 30 minutes in and you realize why Paramount decided to release via Netflix. I don&apos;t think anyone who loved cloverfield will be particularly taken by this film. And to those people who felt cloverfield lane was a bait and switch, they will really feel betrayed by this film. The acting in this film is respectable. The effects, set and the like are fine. But the dull plot is not overcome by having a single character to care about.",
