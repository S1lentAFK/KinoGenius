    "reviewBody": "I watch this twice and I&apos;ve always found a bit confusing and interesting. I&apos;ll try to watch it again and grasp it. The fact that Chadwick Bozeman was fighting cancer whilst filming this just shows what a great actor he is. He should really get an award and I really want to like this movie just because of what he did..",
