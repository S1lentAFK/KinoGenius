    "reviewBody": "Independent films have the ability to tell unique stories that studio films would rather not touch. This film definitely has that going for it. Tight storytelling as you can tell with the run time shows confidence in the story rather than leathering it with unnecessary minutes. Give this film a chance if you are looking for original storytelling.",
