    "reviewBody": "The visuals are great, but there is no story. The film is just a collage of scenes with strange creatures appearing for no reason at all. The vast number of characters don&apos;t help to make the plot any easier to decipher. The only scenes that I enjoyed are the ones in Hogwarts. That&apos;s because at least I know what they are about.",
