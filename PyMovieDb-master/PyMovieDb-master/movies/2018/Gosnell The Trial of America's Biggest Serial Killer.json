    "reviewBody": "This isn&apos;t a show promoting or denouncing abortion, so stop posting reviews if you haven&apos;t actually seen it. This is a show about a butcher pretending to be a doctor, yet was protected by a society that didn&apos;t want to get involved in an abortion debate. After reviewing the case and checking the facts about this man, it is obvious he cared nothing about the health or care of his patients. He had no conscience about using out-of-date medicine - or the use of untrained personnel and unclean surgical instruments - while maintaining a pig-sty environment for his hapless subjects. His being brought to trial was about blatant murders, not about abortions. Both sides of the isle should utter a sigh of relief that justice was served. Being a small budget film, the actors did a good job, but I gave it only an 8 as the script could have been more fleshed out.",
