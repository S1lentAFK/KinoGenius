    "reviewBody": "I didn&apos;t expect much of a movie with a name like Bad Samaritan, I didn&apos;t expect to find something to enjoy about it besides David Tennant playing the villain, and I certainly didn&apos;t expect to find a great movie. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guy&apos;s backstory was dumb, and honestly would have been better off unexplained. I haven&apos;t seen a movie this consistently intense since The Infiltrator came out two years ago. I was especially impressed with the continuity and attention to detail, and MY GOSH can David Tennant pull off a fantastic American accent.",
