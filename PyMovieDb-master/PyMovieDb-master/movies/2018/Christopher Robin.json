    "reviewBody": "This was the first movie in ages where they did not focus on a romantic relationship but rather exploring relationships between friendship and family. Though, I do believe that the movie isn&apos;t suiting for very young viewers. As it might seem boring to them or rather the message conveyed isn&apos;t about them. Christopher Robin forgets about being happy due to his workaholic nature, this could really relate more to high school, college or working people. But, overall it&apos;s a great movie! It&apos;s great for laughs, reminiscing and a little tears",
