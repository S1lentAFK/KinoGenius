    "reviewBody": "This film tells the story of a high school party turning out of control.\n\nThere are a lot of films about high school party, but this one is probably is the craziest. The events escalate gradually to the point of being outrageous, which is what makes the film very entertaining. What is more, is that the story is almost believable!",
