    "reviewBody": "Comic-Con Episode IV: A Fan's Hope is a well made documentary - apparently made to order for the geekiest. I doesn't try to uncover some deep dark secrets behind this famous convention, which has grown from a small gathering of comic book and superhero die hards to a major convention, but simply shows us what happens at this convention. And just following some of the people interacting with others is really quite interesting to watch\n\nWatching the people who attended the 2010 convention, including comic book dealer, Chuck; Holly, a costume designer and a couple of fans trying to get their ideas sold; one soon realizes that this is a salute to the event itself. There is a strong and very real feeling of camaraderie with pretty much everyone that attends. This is because the geeks have conquered (as they probably should) and appreciate their growth in numbers. There really isn't a strong opposing view on Comic-Con or what it is all about. But that's okay, because that is not what this is about. it is about the people, their characteristics and what happens at this convention, which has become a real force to be reckoned with.\n\nOnce again, director Morgan Spurlock (Supersize Me) has brought us a documentary that is entertaining while giving us some insight in his subject matter.",
