    "reviewBody": "The movie is engaging, paced quite well, and the acting is better then average for a film of it's class.\n\nI've seen a lot of negative reviews and have to assume that their expectations were either for something different or just to high. Rarely is a sequel as good as the original movie but this one comes close, it's just a bit over the top at times and quite different then the first one.",
