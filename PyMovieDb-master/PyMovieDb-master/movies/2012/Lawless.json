    "reviewBody": "Reading the other reviews, I&apos;m amused by the number of reviewers who don&apos;t have a clue about how southern rural hill people behave (and esp. behaved back in the 1920s). They accuse Hardy, and to some extent LaBeouf, of bad acting because their characters are so laconic (that means they don&apos;t run off at the mouth a lot) and inward and don&apos;t wear every emotion on their sleeves. Then they mightily praise Oldman and Pearce for great acting when they were, in fact, just playing northern urban gangsters who like to behave over the top---the very thing that disgusts southern sensibilities.\\n\\nThe folks making those review comments have probably spent too much time watching movies based on comic books and not enough time with dramatic characters representing actual human beings. So don&apos;t pay attention to their noise.\\n\\nInstead, watch the flick. It&apos;s good. I enjoyed it.",
