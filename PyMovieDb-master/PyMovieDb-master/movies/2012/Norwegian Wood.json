    "reviewBody": "'Norwegian Wood', a Beatles-song from their album 'Rubber Soul' (1965), makes the very clever inspiration here. Its mood amazingly connects with that of the film, as well as that of Haruki Murakami's book from 1987.\n\nBoth book and film are very Japanese. So be prepared for a slow pace, allowing you plenty of time to catch up with its story. Be prepared for a Japanese styling as well. The film also follows the book's plot, more precisely than we are used to in our Western world.\n\nNou doubt the film 'Norwegian wood' peaks with its acting. Here we talk true Japanese high quality. The unfortunate contrast is made by its disappointing picturing. One can only guess if this is due to a lack of money, or to the desire to apply to 1969-shooting methods.\n\nAll in all 'Norwegian wood' is an enjoyable & well made film, allowing you a pleasant evening in the cinema. Those around in 1969 will get themselves carried back to their young days.",
