    "reviewBody": "This was Debbie Reynolds' last movie but a waste of great talent including Louis Mustillo and many others.\n\nIt is alright for something running in the background or while you are reading, but not a film as the main entertainment.\n\nI give it a 6 for the cast and, as I said, Debbie's last movie, out of respect.",
