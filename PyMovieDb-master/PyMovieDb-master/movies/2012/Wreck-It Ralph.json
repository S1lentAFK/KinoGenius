    "reviewBody": "This is a great movie.\n\nFor someone who grew up with computer games from their conception, I found lots of little nuggets in here to make me smile.\n\nThe story is surprisingly sophisticated for a cartoon and the characters are quite fleshed out considering its target audience.\n\nI saw this at the pictures and I was glued. The child we took to see it (and some others in the cinema) didn't seem as gripped.\n\nI would have liked it if they had visited a few more games.\n\nI would recommend this, especially if you like computer games and want something you can enjoy as well as the kids.",
