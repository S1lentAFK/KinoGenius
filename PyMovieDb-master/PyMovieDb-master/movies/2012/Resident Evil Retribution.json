    "reviewBody": "The wastelands of Russia is where they all go, deep down underneath it's best to move with the flow, in simulated worlds where everything's pretend, excepting of course the finality of end. It's amazing the visions computers can screen, especially controlled by the psychotic Red Queen, with cascades of clones conveyed at her will, banks of fresh meat ready to rupture and spill. How long can this perpetual carnage continue, the raking of flesh from the bone and the sinew, mutations of mutations morph change with variations, to create eternal versions of the worst abominations.",
