    "reviewBody": "Go into 'Entrance' blindly.\n\nDon't look up anything about this movie, not even a plot summary or trailer. I had no idea what kind of movie it was, so when it all came together in the end it was an unforgettable experience.\n\n'Entrance' is a very creatively and craftily made no-budget movie. It is the best film of its kind that I've seen in years.\n\nThis is an incredible effort that I would recommend to anyone looking for something that is atypically effective and defies the norm.\n\nThe shot composition in 'Entrance' is outstanding, the directors certainly know how to frame a shot. The acting is superb, there was a great suspension of disbelief throughout that normally doesn't happen with such low budget efforts. These filmmakers have a bright future ahead of them, and I can't wait to see what they do next.\n\nGreat stuff all around, enjoy!",
