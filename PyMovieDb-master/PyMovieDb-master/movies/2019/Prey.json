    "reviewBody": "Had to start a 30-day trial on Hulu just to watch it but It was pretty boss, so I&apos;m not mad. The story was basic and took us back to the roots of the Predator franchise with its pre-America setting.\n\nLike the new predator deign but far more impressed by how the new predator moved and reacted. Whoever they got in the costume was really doing some acting, making himself look like the baddest hunter on the block. It does not stand out any better than any of the other Predator movies in my book but as far as being the first one by 20th Century Studios done under the Disney Banner it was violent and gory enough for my taste.\n\nWorth possibly getting Hulu for.",
