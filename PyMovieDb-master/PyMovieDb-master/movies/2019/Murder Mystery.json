    "reviewBody": "Enjoyable lightweight comedy (possibly sponsored by Claritin!) from Adam Sandler that benefits greatly from the presence of the often under-rated Jennifer Aniston. They play a couple who finds themselves in the middle of the kind of old-fashioned murder mystery plot that Aniston&apos;s character loves to read. The film plays on genre tropes to decent effect and Sandler reins in the annoyance quotient, although given today&apos;s climate of gender sensitivity it&apos;s likely that vaguely ditzy female characters like Aniston&apos;s - who can pause in a moment of panic to admire some nearby wallpaper - will soon go the way of murders in the library with a candlestick.",
