    "reviewBody": "Too long, too still, too monotone. These things need to be measured and have a tempo. Questions needed to be asked that these characters don&apos;t. How, why, what led him to this conclusion. He explains this to his own satisfaction, but certainly that shouldn&apos;t be enough to the others. Unplugged Tv and telephone ringing could have definitely been used as forces of interruption and movement of the main character, but wasn&apos;t enough.\n\nWith the calm dialog and quietness set to create a mood of a possible evil held below or sensitive insanity, there needs to be something that moves us along. It was like walking into a quiet house, having a quiet conversation, having a drink waiting for something to happen in a dimly lit place. Could be much better.",
