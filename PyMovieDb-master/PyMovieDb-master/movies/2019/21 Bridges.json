    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t think there are many things that will be open or rather not openly foreseeable for most of the viewers. I did have one character reveal that I did not think about, but other than that ... But as it is, this movie works as a thriller, even when you know what&apos;s up.\n\nOur Black Panther is doing a great job as a stern and immovable cop, with a tough Sienna Miller to his side. Fighting to bring justice and being very aware of local geography (not sure if it is entirely plausible what happens, but it helps further the tension and keep you on the edge of your seat).\n\nTwists aside, this is fun and action packed, what more can one ask for? Yes a few things more, but this is decent",
