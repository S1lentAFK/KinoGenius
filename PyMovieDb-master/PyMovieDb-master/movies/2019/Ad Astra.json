    "reviewBody": "Explore the galaxy. Search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we self-destructive? Are we willing to continue until the end regardless of the consequences? Do we become what we judge without realizing it? The story that the film tells us has a very deep meaning and explores the most hidden corners of the human being. A slow movie that goes through the stages of degradation and collapse of an individual feeling lost and the will to continue forward and get up to reach a goal. The sound and score, the photography, the scenarios and landscapes, the cinematography, the direction and the colours are really gorgeous.",
