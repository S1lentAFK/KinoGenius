    "reviewBody": "I sought out The Aftermath primarily because of an interest in its setting, post war occupied Germany. What I found was a well made film, full of great performances. All of the characters in this film were emotionally wounded in some way and it was fascinating to watch them clash and interact.\n\nA handsome and compelling production, I don&apos;t understand some of the poor reviews I&apos;ve seen for this movie. Romantic films really aren&apos;t my thing but The Aftermath held my attention throughout its running time.\n\nGreat ending too.",
