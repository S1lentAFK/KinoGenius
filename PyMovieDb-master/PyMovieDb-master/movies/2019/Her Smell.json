    "heading": "This is a pretty good but very weird punk rock indie drama that had its wider release last year.",
    "reviewBody": "The movie is almost like 5 short films in one, or like a play, even. It&apos;s about a washed-up all-girl punk band and the lead singer&apos;s relationship with her bandmates and her family. This movie can be really over-the-top and crazy, the main character kinda feels like Harley Quinn at times, but it can also be really down-to-earth and quiet. I really loved the look of this movie, it goes from being really dark and colourful and dirty to more well-lit and clean as the main character develops. I found her performance a little bit too much and one-note at times, but Elizabeth Moss really shows her range by the end of the movie. The rest of the actors are good too! The story moves a little slowly and the movie is a little too long, but overall, this is a solid film.",
