    "reviewBody": "With the first two full length features in the franchise being some of my favourite animated movies out there, I had high expectations going in; i was not disappointed at all. The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way. With the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story. The animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010. It contains numerous homages to the first film that will make all viewers laugh and cry alike. Overall, a very pleasing and emotionally affecting end to the saga with a strong emotional message about friendship",
