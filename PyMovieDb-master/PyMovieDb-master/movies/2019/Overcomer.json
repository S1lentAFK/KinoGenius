    "reviewBody": "I love all of the Kendrick Brothers films but initially found this one to be a little predictable and a little on the cheesy side in the beginning. However the latter half of the movie really drew me in and made that impact like I have come to expect from these films! Finding our true identity can only be found in Christ. Unfortunately we need that reminder!",
