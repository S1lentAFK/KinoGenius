    "reviewBody": "I have no clue what those people are on about stating the story is confusing or that there&apos;s no story at all. To me it all made perfect sense, in fact I thought the storytelling was sublime, going back and forth in time, between the young and adult characters, it was all very easy to follow for once. The acting was excellent and that from the entire cast. The Goldfinch definitely deserves a higher rating on here. It&apos;s one of those movies I would watch again in the future. I wasn&apos;t expecting much of it to be honest, as the drama genre isn&apos;t really the genre I enjoy the most but this one stands out from the rest. A captivating story, excellent acting, very high quality of cinematography, I really can&apos;t write anything bad about The Goldfinch. Good job from the whole production team.",
