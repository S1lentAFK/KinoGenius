    "reviewBody": "Basically the same thing as Deep (2017); boring, atrocious and dumb jokes. I think that the story is weak, as there isn&apos;t really any potential for the movie. They fill it with potty humour and fart jokes. I can&apos;t say anything else because it&apos;s just so weak and boring.",
