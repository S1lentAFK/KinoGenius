I had a good time and 2 extra stars just for Dennis quaid. He gave a crazy fun performance which made me and other audience feel uncomfortable at certain times. Especially the shower scene in bathroom, that&apos;s just pure gold. It&apos;s so uncomfortable that you&apos;ll just laugh. Overall its a fun movie to watch with your friends in a weekend.",
