  "description": "Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Working as an elf in a year-round Christmas store is not good for the wannabe singer. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn--that seems too good to be true.",

    "reviewBody": "I liked the fact that this wasn&apos;t your typical overly saccharine Christmas romcom. Some light and quirky comedy bits well placed within a heartfelt and mature storyline that doesn&apos;t try to go too deep. The result is a good little watch that makes you feel improved slightly for having seen it.",
