    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t understand why the reviews for this one are so bad. I found this movie quite enjoyable. The acting seemed fine to me and the scenery and costume designs were really lovely. I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I suppose those looking for the traditional portrayal of Hamlet might be disappointed. I enjoyed the updated dialogue and storyline from Ophelia&apos;s point of view. Give it a chance - you&apos;ll likely be pleased you did.",
