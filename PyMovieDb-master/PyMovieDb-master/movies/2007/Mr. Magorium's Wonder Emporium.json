    "reviewBody": "We all really enjoyed Mr Magorium.\\n\\nIt has a wonderful sense of magic about it and very good solid performances from the leads.\\n\\nMost of all it is the Emporium, the toy store that provides much of the wonder: real care, thought, and a real sense of wonder pervade the set.\\n\\nThe story is lovingly done, and never too schmaltzy.\\n\\nWe came away talking about our favorite bits the kids remembered lots of small details: a sure sign they really did lose themselves in the movies.\\n\\nOverall I would say one of the better films for kids that doesn't try to be anything other than it is: it reminded me of 1970s Disney, simple, innocent, magic.",
