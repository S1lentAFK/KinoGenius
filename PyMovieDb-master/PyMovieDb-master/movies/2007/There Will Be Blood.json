    "reviewBody": "It has been a while since I watched a film where the acting and casting is so damn convincing - I have to start this review by saying that.\\n\\nThe plot is definitely off the beaten track anf the writing very very much a breath of fresh air.\\n\\nUnfortunately this is a film that can come down to tastes quite a bit when the reviews come round, and although I can&apos;t necessarily critique it specifically, there is something about it that I just couldn&apos;t get gripped by, and the ending didn&apos;t truly satisfy me (though the end scene itself is probably the high point of the movie. Confusing review, I know)\\n\\nThis is not a negative review by any means, but 8-10 are reserved for films that truly get you talking, or have a huge emotional impact in my opinion\\n\\nAs a recommendation, this film is a definite yes. I believe that I am on the side of people who this genre doesn&apos;t appeal to much at all, but as a piece of film and a showcase of acting, it is utterly utterly great.",
