    "reviewBody": "This began as a typical island movie with some disturbing twists. This movie kept interesting for about three minutes. It reminded me a lot of 'lord of the flies' just with two guys and a girl. There was a little passion flare but that about did it. the ending was quite good. I was pleased with it. the acting was believable in some areas i just think the story line needed something else. They had pretty poor special effects. To me it didn't quite make it. I enjoyed some parts of the movie but it just didn't 'thrill' If you are scared of most thrillers then this one should be okay to watch. so i give it a 5 out of 10. my boyfriend and i watched it and i gave it a 6 and he gave it a 4 so this is the reason for the 5. even though it had a bit of sexual scenes. they could of taken away the small amount of boob action and made it an M rating.",
