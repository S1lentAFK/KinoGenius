    "reviewBody": "I don't write typical reviews because I'm not really smart enough. I'll leave that for those willing to be bright enough to cover all the dimensions of a film. That being said, this movie appeals to your heart and makes you feel something. A little about love, a little about loss, and a little about how important honesty is in relationships and in life in general. It tells you that most importantly, you need to be honest with yourself, but also you really need to find out what to look for in this great journey of life.\n\nI believe Morgan Freeman led a excellent cast of actors, but what I noticed more in the narrative was his distinct voice of reason that Mr. Freeman is so exceptional with in every film he does. So, if you decide to take my advice and spend a couple hours away from your routine to take in this wonderful little film, try to view it from a perspective that its message of thoughtfulness, courage, and heart might endure long after its over.\n\nI also enjoyed some great acting efforts from the always good Greg Kinnear and the Aussie Radha Mitchell, which I think are worth mentioning separately, but the whole cast was good. The film basically follows five distinct relationships (six if you count Morgan Freeman's marriage) as they fall in love, stay in love, or fall out of love. The story line is a little chaotic and improbable at times, but like I said in the beginning, sometimes you have to spare the analysis, and let the experience just gobble you up and let you go. The better films will do that. Happy viewing!",
