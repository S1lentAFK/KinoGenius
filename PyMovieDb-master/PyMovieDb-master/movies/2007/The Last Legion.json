    "reviewBody": "I just got done watching this movie. And I must say, if you really want to see this movie, save yourself an hour and a half, and just watch the trailer. The trailer is really as good as this movie gets. I&apos;m sorry, I had high hopes for this movie too. I&apos;m a big fan of medieval and roman films, but this one really just falls short on everything. I would say thats its worthy of being a sci-fi channel original movie, but I don&apos;t don&apos;t want to insult the sci-fi channel (Seriously, they have tons of aliens and monster, don&apos;t tick them off. You will get eaten.)\\n\\nThis movie falls short on pretty much every account. Casting was awful. I&apos;m a fan of Sangster, he was great in Love Actually, but he&apos;s not yet strong enough to be a leading man. Firth, with his quirky charm, should stick to romantic comedy. He&apos;s much better at fumbling through a confession of love than being an epic hero. The plot, dialog, acting and directing were all horrible. I kept sitting there thinking how it could have been done better, only to come to the realization the best thing to do would be to throw out everything and start over from the plot outline. The sets cheap and generic. They would have done better dusting off set pieces from Ben Hur(1959). Costumes were pulled from every generic Barbarian/Roman stock wardrobe or Halloween store. Perhaps one of the most distracting things was the music. I think the composer is sleeping with one or more of his trumpet players because thats all we heard. Trumpets playing as they hide, Trumpets sounding during the battle, Trumpets here, Trumpets there. Couldn&apos;t get enough of them.\\n\\nAt best this movie is a rental to watch at home. When you&apos;re alone. In a windowless room. Don&apos;t invite your friends over, they will make fun of you. I&apos;m sorry if this sounds cruel, but, like the parent of a child failing kindergarten, I&apos;m simply trying to express my disappointment for a film that could have been so much better. Its just sad.",
