    "reviewBody": "I could not get into the story at all, and cannot identify with the characters. Initially the film shows two people having sex all the time. Then the rest of the film is very dialog heavy, but they are ore drivels than actual conversations. I find the film very boring, even though it has Ethan Hawke, Laura Linney and Michelle Williams, all of whom I like very much.",
