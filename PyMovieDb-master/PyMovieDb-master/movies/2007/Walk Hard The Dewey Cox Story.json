    "reviewBody": "And if there is a musical genre out there short of orchestral symphony, it gets sent up by this wonderful comedy.\\n\\nNot a movie for the kiddies by a long shot, but if you are familiar with music artists from the 50s on, and especially if you lived through those periods of time, the parody of styles and stars will leave you with sore sides from laughing.\\n\\nMake sure to listen closely to every lyric. They don&apos;t miss a chance to make jokes subtle or broad, and they don&apos;t take it easy on anyone.\\n\\nSongs in the credits are just as funny as songs through the body of the movie, so make sure to wait around for those rather than switching off after the story itself fades to black.\\n\\nA personal favorite of mine are the scenes where Dewey discovers new drugs. Although I&apos;ve never taken drugs, even smoked marijuana, these scenes were just too funny to be offensive, especially the first discussion of the weed just named.\\n\\nBe in the mood to watch a comedy, especially for a parody of this type. If you can&apos;t really pay attention, you won&apos;t get everything, and will just think the movie crude. Also, if you&apos;re really stuck up about what&apos;s in your comedy, then you may not like this movie.\\n\\nIf you&apos;re up for it, you&apos;ll die laughing.",
