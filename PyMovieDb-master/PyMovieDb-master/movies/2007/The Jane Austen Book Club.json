    "reviewBody": "I like movies with spaceships in, preferably exploding at some point. Also shooting, sword fighting and violent death. Oh, and car chases. And if I can&apos;t have the above, then can there at least be some explicit sex please? \\n\\nAnd yet I loved this movie.\\n\\nI loved the nerdiness, I loved the intimacy, I loved watching it unfold exactly as you know it&apos;s going to. And the chemistry between Hugh Dancy and the gorgeous Maria Bello crackles off the screen.\\n\\nI know, I know, you could level this movie without much effort. You wouldn&apos;t even need that big of a stick. But you find yourself not caring.\\n\\nThis film is pure pleasure, start to finish. I gladly relinquish one of my Man cards for saying that. I&apos;m off to watch something with guns in to compensate, though.",
