    "reviewBody": "Listen, this movie does have some comedy in it. It is what it is, and knowing the main characters and subject you are getting what you expect to get. This movie starts out a little slow but eventually builds up into a film that can hold it&apos;s own. This movie was fluid enough to keep me entertained and laughing here and there so it&apos;s not half bad. The fight scenes are good for the men. There is a romantic side of the movie too for the women,and a cultural touch as well. It is also very patriotic in the sense that it&apos;s a military movie and I&apos;m sure many GI&apos;s will enjoy this movie too. Give it a chance if you have 90 minutes of free time, you may be surprised.",
