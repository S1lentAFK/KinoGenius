    "reviewBody": "Susan Sarandon looked fine, in fact great for her character. I thought the movie was funny and just plain entertaining.\n\nI liked the broad humor as well as the occasional slapstick bit. In addition, there was some social/philosophical commentary that went well with the light tone of the movie. \n\nAlthough the 'Cornival' was a bit corny, that was the point. John, Mr. Woodcock's nemesis, was searching for a connection with his roots and eventually realized that he was more disconnected than he thought, having to change his general outlook and his relationships with the people he most cared about.",
