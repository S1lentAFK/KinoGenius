From start to finish it is beyond inspiring - by the end, it lifts right off the ground.\n\nThe first time the soundtrack really kicked in, I felt that Eddie Vedder's score seemed too loud. Then I realized that my only complaint was merely me resisting the full experience. The whole point of it all was to let go and not be afraid of going that one step too far.",
