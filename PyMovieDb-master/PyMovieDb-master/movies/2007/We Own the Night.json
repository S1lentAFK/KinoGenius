    "reviewBody": "We Own the Night (2007) is a powerful film based on a dark atmosphere, literally and figuratively. First of all, many, if not most, scenes are shot at night with an obvious aesthetic sense. Then, the topic deals with the violent conflict between the Russian underworld and the NYPD, within the Brooklyn of the 80s. It's an ultimate film noir: crime, treason, jealousy and fatalism are themes adroitly developed by James Gray and marvelously interpreted by an awesome cast. Robert Duvall is a honest and accomplished policeman, a wise and protector father, Eva Mendes is a deliberately inflammatory woman, Mark Wahlberg is the ideal son and then Joaquin Phoenix is the 'second' son with a slightly tortured mind and who seeks his own place in the shadow of his family. In my humble opinion, this movie is clearly underrated. As a synthesis: 8/9 of 10.",
