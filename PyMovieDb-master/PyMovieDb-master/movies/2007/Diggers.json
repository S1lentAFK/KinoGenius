    "reviewBody": "Well, this an interesting movie. I liked it. I liked the characters, and the story was okay. Not a fast moving film, but that's okay. It goes along at it's own pace.\n\nThe characters are believable for the most part. It's hard to believe this film is set just an hour away from Manhatten.\n\nSo, here's my beef with this film. Certain things have become too commonplace in current films. Do we really need the vulgar language all the time? Is that a modern thing? Second, for some reason, there always had to be a sex scene. Do we really need that all the time? And thirdly, there always seems to be a seen of someone going to the bathroom , which in this film happens more than once. Come on film makers, some things really need to be implied and left to the imagination. I don't want to watch a movie and see a guy sitting on the toilet.",
