    "reviewBody": "This film has to be one of my favourites since I was forced to watch it by cultural people. Luckily I was not disappointed.\\n\\nThe general story is of a Brian (McAvoy), an intelligent and clever young man who after going to university in Bristol, joins the University Challenge team. During this time, he falls for an attractive blonde on the team called Alice (Eve) while being completely oblivious to the affections of the beautiful intellectual, Rebecca Epstein (Hall).\\n\\nThe film has a great cast and some good comedy moments. A great cast, and some good dialogue. There&apos;s not much else to say about it, but that if you ever feel unhappy and depressed, watch this gem, it will not disappoint in cheering you up.",
