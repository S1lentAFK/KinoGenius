    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve just read the first review on here and I&apos;m a little surprised at the things it said but as always, these things are only an opinion. Anyway, I went to the World Premiere last night and here&apos;s what I thought.\\n\\nThe plot is fairly simple - Hugh Grant plays a washed out 80s pop star with a flair for melodies but no clue about lyrics. Cue the dizzy plant-girl (do people really have a plant-girl??) Drew Barrymore who can throw lyrics together without a problem. The relationship between Drew and Hugh is built well - especially when you remember that Drew is 31 and Hugh is 47. There&apos;s nothing wrong with such a gap, I&apos;m simply saying the chemistry is there (or they would have looked a little creepy).\\n\\nHaley Bennett plays Cora, a Britney/Christina/Shakira mish-mash who is looking to do a duet with Hugh&apos;s character. She is brilliant at the shallow, superficial teen-nymphette and it&apos;s a surprise to see that it&apos;s her first feature. And check out her costumes! The soundtrack is good fun - pretend 80s songs mix with Cora&apos;s modern pop and the Hugh/Drew demo track is nice too. One of the songs sounds a bit like The Whitlams. The spoken section at the very start of the film sounded awful but the rest was fine - maybe the cinema&apos;s problem but I was in the Odeon Leicester Square....\\n\\nThe editing seemed a tiny bit, er, clunky at times - scenes cut into each other messily and dialogue at one point seemed to be cut short. It hadn&apos;t been but it just sounded that way at the time.\\n\\nI didn&apos;t expect to like the film that much - I only went as I fancy Drew to bits (and having seen her close up I&apos;m right to!) but both my girlfriend and I came out laughing and humming the main song. It&apos;s genuinely as good as any other Hugh Grant film and is another great performance from Drew (though it doesn&apos;t get near Wedding Singer or Doppelganger (joking about Doppelganger)). It&apos;s well worth going to see at the cinema and is a proper feel good rom-com. There&apos;s no shame in it for us fellas as Drew is nice to look at, as is Haley. My girlfriend loved it.",
