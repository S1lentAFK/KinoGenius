    "reviewBody": "Luke Wilson is a drug dealer who comes out of prison less of a wiseacre than when he went in. He&apos;s got a job at an old-folk&apos;s home, but despite his amiability, when he sees his old girl friend, Eva Mendes, he wants to reconnect. The old geezers at the home try to help him out.\\n\\nIt&apos;s an amiable if underwritten movie, carried on the charms of its leads..... but they don&apos;t seem to be up to making this movie work. A good cast, including Owen Wilson, Seymour Cassell, Harry Dean Stanton and Kris Kristoferson collect paychecks.",
