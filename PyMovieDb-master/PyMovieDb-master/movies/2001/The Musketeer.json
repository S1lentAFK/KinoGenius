    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m a huge Dumas fan and watch every one of the adaptations but I missed this one originally. Just caught it on netflix and it&apos;s nowhere near as bad as it&apos;s made out to be. Yes, the lead is a little off and there isn&apos;t much chemistry between him and Mena Suvari who isn&apos;t at her best either. The wire based fight scenes look dated and there are a few scene pacing problems.\\n\\nBut overall this was quite fun. There *is* chemistry between the Queen and D&apos;artagnan thanks to Catherine Deneuve who exudes star quality in every scene she&apos;s in. There are some nice performances from most of the character actors, the original 3 musketeers are great, and the humor if not the plot is very in keeping with the book. \\n\\nI first thought this was a made for TV movie because of the credits at the beginning so I wasn&apos;t really expecting much and this definitely beat my expectations. The movie looks good and aside from a few characters most of them seem fairly real, the balance between schtick and too- serious was handled well.\\n\\nOverall, too many faults to be a classic but definitely enough class and fun to be very entertaining. Recommended for fans of period movies and the tongue in cheek dramedy.",
