    "reviewBody": "Beethoven's 4th is basically a sad attempt continuing a series that needs neither another movie, nor another direct to video spin-off.\nThe movie seems more of a wishbone type wannabe, with its simplistic plot that doesn't even completely make sense and silly sight gags. While some of the movie is a bit funny, like Judge Reinhold trying to get Michalangelo (Beethoven's look-a-like) to behave like Beethoven, the movie is one to be skipped.\nI'm not sure if 3 and 4 were filmed back to back, since this movie does carry a copyright date of 2000 on it. However, Beethoven's 3rd wasn't even theatre releasable, so the decision had to have been to make 2 direct to videos.\nAnyway, Judge Reinhold should try better choices, at least ones that don't have him drinking out of a toilet.\nRating: 2",
