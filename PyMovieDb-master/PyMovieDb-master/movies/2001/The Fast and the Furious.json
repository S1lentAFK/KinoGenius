    "reviewBody": "I don&apos;t remember when the first time was that I saw The Fast and the Furious but it dosen&apos;t matter because it gets better with each viewing. This movie is filled with what guys want to see; Hot and fast tricked out cars, beautiful women, and kick ass action sequences. The world that the characters live in in this film is the world we can only dream of, to race in cool tricked out cars with dozens of beautiful women surrounding you and cheering you on. All of this is what I love most about this film but I also love the cast; Vin Diesal, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster all clinch their roles. If I were to pick my favorite cast member I would have to go with Michelle Rodriguez because not only is she a talented actress she is beautiful and bad ass in everything she&apos;s ever been in and this is probably my favorite role of hers. This is a movie were you really don&apos;t have to care about the plot because all the eye-candy and fun of this movie is the cars, girls, and action which is enough to pull you into the driver&apos;s seat. The cars are fast the action is furious and that&apos;s why this movie rocks.",
