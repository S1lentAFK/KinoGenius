Tomcats certainly seemed to hit the spot.\\n\\nThere are days when I&apos;m looking for some serious moviegoing or a great spectacle to watch & there are days when I just want to lean back & be entertained.\\n\\nTomcats fell into the latter category & left me with a smile on my face for the weekend.\\n\\nIt would be easy to criticise the film (as a lot of people have done) but much of this criticism seems unfair to me.\\n\\nI&apos;d say give it a try with a few friends - you might just be surprised!",
