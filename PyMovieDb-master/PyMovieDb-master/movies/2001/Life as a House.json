    "reviewBody": "Yes... my title says it all. this is my favourite movie and i&apos;m not ashamed to say it. This movie is placed together very well, it not only explores a broken family, but a broken person fixed by the love of his dyin father. i watch this movie probably at least 3 times a month and it never ceases to make me cry. it&apos;s not so much the fact that the plot is emotional, but these actors make it seem so real, and although i know it&apos;s their job to do that, i think they have extremely well. I am, understandably an emotional person who has felt the loss of a parent at a young age, and i guess it&apos;s that in the movie which hits close to home. I would personally recommend this to anyone who wants a movie bout broken families, and reunited love. a tearjerker to those who feel the plot and brokenness of a boy and his journey.",
