    "reviewBody": "Good looking, fast paced movie with good fight choreography and a simple story. Basically, a female John wick. If not for a little too much sentimentality and a plot twist you can see coming from the start I would have given it an even higher score. Keep your expectations low and your gratitude high and you'll enjoy this one.",
