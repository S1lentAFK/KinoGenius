    "reviewBody": "Above all, this film has a kind of flow to it like nothing I've ever experienced in any other film before. The magic sets in from the very first moment, when we see Donnie waking up (and the song 'The Demon Moon' starts), and you just go with that flow and let yourself be drawn into that world. The story unfolds like a dream and the ambiguity (at least in the theatrical cut) as well as the fantastic songs help create an absolutely unique and strangely compelling atmosphere.\\n\\nFantastic script and fantastic performances: this film has a richness in its characters that amazes me every time I watch it. Forget the director's cut - here for once the theatrical version is the masterpiece. Probably the best social commentary on American society I've ever seen but beautifully woven into an ambiguous, slightly surreal fantasy tale with a haunting soundtrack.\\n\\nMy vote: 10 out of 10\\n\\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\\n\\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\\n\\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\\n\\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",
