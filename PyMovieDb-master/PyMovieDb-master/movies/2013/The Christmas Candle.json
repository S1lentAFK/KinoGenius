    "reviewBody": "I went to watch this movie knowing it was a tale about hope, inspiration and people. I was not disappointed, enjoyed the characters and message from beginning to end. It is the absolute opposite from zombies, explosions, murder and mayhem, and is all the better for it. Not sure if the movie is true to every historical aspect of the time portrayed, but that is not the point. While the audience was small, there were applause at the end, and some folks wiping their eyes and not rushing to get out of the theater. Beware the onion ninjas when watching. Watch this movie with an appreciation for the human spirit and faith, you will not be disappointed and wish we had more movies like this to watch instead of the normal trashy Hollywood fare.",
