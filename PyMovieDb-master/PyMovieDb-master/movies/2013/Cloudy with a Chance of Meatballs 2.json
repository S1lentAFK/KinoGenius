    "reviewBody": "The lack of Lord and Miller is obvious from the film's opening moments, and their absence leaves this film in animated sequel oblivion.\n\nIt had a hard act to follow in the first movie so it was never going to meet expectations, but it didn't come close to emulating the heart of the original. Instead it added more cute characters hoping they'd make up for the lack of intelligent writing.",
