    "reviewBody": "There was no intention to watch this movie. Trailer and story didn't click to me. However, I accidentally watch this movie. \n\nThis movie is about a snail dreams about being Indy 500 race champion. How he get powers, how he enters into the race and finally what happens is a nice journey to watch.\n\nMovie is short and sticks to the story. Animation is really good. I thought as Snail is the hero the movie from their perspective will be very slow but this is never the case.\n\nStory is somewhat acceptable for children but watchable for elders as well. This is a nice movie to watch for 90 mins. \n\nThere is nothing best about the movie. So it is just a watchable. It won't bore you.\n\nOverall Ratings: 6/10",
