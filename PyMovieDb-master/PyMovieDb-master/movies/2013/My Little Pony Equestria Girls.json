    "reviewBody": "There's a lot of things you can say about this movie. Yes, it's corny. Yes, it panders to the fan-base. Yes, the concept is silly. Yes, it's basically an hour-long commercial for a new toy line. But that doesn't change the fact that My Little Pony: Equestria Girls is, honestly, pretty alright. No, it's not perfect, not by a long shot, but then, neither is the show (blasphemy, I know but it's true).\\n\\nIf you're a fan of the show and you take this movie for what it is: the pilot episode for what will hopefully be a decent cartoon and an advertisement for toys, then you'll probably enjoy it. Your kids, if you have any, will most likely enjoy it. If you're not a fan of the show, a kid, or both, then steer clear.",
