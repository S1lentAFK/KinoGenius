    "reviewBody": "Brian A Miller's 'Officer Down' is A Dark Cop-Drama. Its an impressive film, that delivers a gritty story convincingly along-with good performances. \n\n'Officer Down' Synopsis: A corrupt, guilty police officer goes in search for redemption.\n\n'Officer Down' is dark, gritty & violent. Its certainly not meant for the faint-hearted. Brian A Miller's Direction is focused. John Chase's Screenplay is convincing & the second-hour, in particular, has meaty sequences. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Stephen Dorff is remarkable in the lead role. Dominic Purcell is very good. AnnaLynne McCord is a complete natural. Walton Goggins is in decent form, while David Boreanaz & Stephen Lang are routine. James Woods is fantastic in a strong supporting role.\n\nOn the whole, 'Officer Down' deserves a watch.",
