    "reviewBody": "What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.\\n\\n&apos;Top Gun: Maverick&apos; is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it&apos;s actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.\\n\\nThe story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I&apos;m not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It&apos;s all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.\\n\\nTom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis&apos; (unexplained) absence.\\n\\nMonica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it&apos;s done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little clich\\u00e9, though overall I approve.\\n\\nA great watch - I&apos;d highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven&apos;t already.",
