    "reviewBody": "Alice (Juno Temple) and John (Michael Angarano) are a downtrodden struggling couple. After a car accident, Alice finds herself attracted to a roadside antique shop. She steals a teapot and finds that it rewards them with money for every pain and suffering.\\n\\nJohn is way too pathetic to like. He is an annoying little loser. There isn't anything funny about him. Alice is slightly better, because she becomes somewhat evil and she knows it. Quite frankly, I don't know what she sees in him. It takes quite a long while before it gets interesting. It is actually very funny when the couple lands on emotional pain. There is a good 10 minutes of fun jokes there. The rest of the movie is a rather unimpressive comedy with a very cool premise.",
