    "reviewBody": "The movie&apos;s alright. Nothing so special about it but also it&apos;s not bad either. Since it&apos;s not a blockbuster or whatever I didn&apos;t put too much expectation on it so I feel like it&apos;s a decent one to just casually watch. Of course you are not getting crazy deep thoughts out of the movie. It tells a story and that&apos;s it, which for me is easy to understand (I haven&apos;t read the book, though).\n\nThere was action and fighting which I think was good enough with some being really nice, still I do need a little bit more action. The emotions were there and I appreciate that they tried to establish something but for me it&apos;s quite a bit over the top as it seems there was only a way to show the emotional connection so it kinda gets repetitive over time. Apart from that, everything else was fine, the characters had their roles, the color and lightning in some scenes were good which pleased my eyes.\n\nAaron Eckhart did his job well as always. The child actor (Michael A. Waycaster) was pretty good.\n\nSolid 6.5 for me but props to some really nice scenes I&apos;ll give it a 7.",
