    "reviewBody": "This film is Masterwork one of the greatest films of the last few years. However, since it does not have... it can not win any awards. This is the case because awards now mandate... be enforced on all films. I am surprised it got funding to be made considering that it... A lot of excellent scripts go unfunded and are not made because they are not... enough.\n\nToo bad if you come up with an idea for a Masterwork but if you do not have enough... it will never be made.\n\nIn this day and age even certain topics are forbidden but they are important to learn from the evil of the past so you do not repeat it when fighting that evil today. Ironic isn&apos;t it?",
