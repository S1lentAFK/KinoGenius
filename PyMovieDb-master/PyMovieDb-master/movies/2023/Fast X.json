    "reviewBody": "&apos;&apos;The Fast franchise is a film series that should have disappeared a long, long time ago.&apos;&apos; Someone wrote here. I think it&apos;s Vin Diesel that starts to get so annoying and so smug with the whole script around his character, the old same quotes and &apos;&apos;the family&apos;&apos; always being pronounced without any emotion capable of revealing the slightest talent as an actor.\n\nJohn Cena was an extra to help me follow the movie almost till the end. Jason Mamoa was very refreshing and devilishly funny. But both soon started to lose their characters in such script so poorly structured.\n\nJason Statham would have done better than the &apos;&apos;star&apos;&apos; who persists in being the center of the attention of the world wich seems to be always against him.\n\nThe script seems to have jumped from writer to writer with several sequences that seems to only serve to fill time and film, but without contributing much to the continuity and outcome of the story.\n\nA disappointment for anyone who would have expected something more exciting.",
