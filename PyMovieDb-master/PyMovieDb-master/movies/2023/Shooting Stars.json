    "reviewBody": "Shooting Stars is an excellent High School sports movie. The character development, directing, editing, and acting are all on point.\n\nBased on a true story it captures the progression of friends perfectly to their journey from kids to young adults. It&apos;s an uplifting film about what it means to grow up together and support one another through life&apos;s challenges.\n\nIt&apos;s captivating from the first scene to last. There aren&apos;t many such movies I&apos;ve seen where I felt part of the groups struggle and perseverance. It&apos;s uplifting and courageous.\n\nI&apos;m glad I caught it as I was scrolling through to find something to watch.\n\nHighly recommend it!",
