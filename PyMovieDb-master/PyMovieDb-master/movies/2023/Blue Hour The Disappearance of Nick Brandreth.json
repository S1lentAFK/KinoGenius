    "reviewBody": "And unfortunately this just doesn&apos;t have it. Really unique premise, but the acting just kills it. Poor acting is an absolute death sentence for found footage as it just rips us out of the story. You don&apos;t need the best actors, as proven by many found footage movies, but just natural dialogue. This you could absolutely tell was reading from a script. Really great use of vintage footage, fun edits and overall concept. Was really hoping to like it, but 30 min in just lost me and wasn&apos;t picking up the pace fast enough. More discerning editing and better actors would highly enhance the movie to the next level.",
