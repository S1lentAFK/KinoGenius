    "reviewBody": "2.5 out of 5 stars.\n\nInsidious The Red Door is a pretty bad supernatural horror film that is starting to become dead end for the franchise. The concept is creepy and scary about a person astral projecting into the realm the further were lost souls and demonic entity can find you.\n\nThe plot is a conclusion to the Lambert family after seeing them in the second movie in the series. Is it really a necessary sequel? Not really. Plot follows 9 years later. Dalton is going to college while his father is still feeling hazy after they were hypnotized to forget the events on the second film. Until they both discover they can astral project again and something sinister comes there way.\n\nThe film is more of a story about father and son trying to resolve with each others mystery conflict. The movie has less scares and thrills. Which is very few in between. Some cheap jump scares that does not do the trick with this film.\n\nThe cast is okay in the film but the script is a bit dull with there characters.\n\nOverall, the fifth film bites the dust in the further and it might as well be skipped.",
