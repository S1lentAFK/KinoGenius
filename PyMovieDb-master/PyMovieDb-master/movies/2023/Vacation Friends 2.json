    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not sure why there are so many negative reviews, if you liked the first movie you are all but guaranteed to like the first half of this movie as it is very similar.\n\nThe second half of the movie is more like an unrealistic action comedy that is not to be taken seriously, but there are still some laughs to be had. I respect that they didn&apos;t copy the first movie throughout the entire film.\n\nIf you go into this movie expecting a masterpiece or for it to be exactly the same as the first movie you are going to be disappointed, but if you lower your expectations a little you will be entertained for the entire 100 minutes.",
