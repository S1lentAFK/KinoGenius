    "reviewBody": "Of course any recent journalistic true crime thriller will owe a debt too the grandaddy of them all, Zodiac ,to its 60s design, to creepy supporting players offering evidence that is a dead end (Charles Fleischer&apos;s movie buff projectionist), to shoe leather investigating, phone calls in the night with heavy breathing and obsession.\n\nIf one is too be inspired/steal then do it from the best.\n\nThis is a solid,well told thriller, Keira Knightley&apos;s accent is better than I was expecting and whilst it isn&apos;t as good as &apos;She Said&apos; the female investigating team has charm, originality and something to say.",
