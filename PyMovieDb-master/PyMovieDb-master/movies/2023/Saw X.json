    "reviewBody": "Saw X definitely has the gruesome goods expected of a Saw film however, what makes this entry really good is the unexpected amount of heart. It&apos;s a personal tale of revenge that&apos;s oddly wholesome, using its concept to make its traps and victim&apos;s suffering enjoyable viewing.\n\nFront and centre like never before Tobin Bell gets to lead this one and it&apos;s absolutely all the better for it. The relief when he believes he&apos;s cured and the realisation it&apos;s all fake is heartbreaking which makes him easy to root for. Also, his bond with Shawnnee Smith feels so genuine.\n\nKevin Greutert&apos;s direction is really good, it&apos;s the same style that the rest of the franchise has but as a prequel trying to match that same aesthetic it works. The traps here are inventive, gross and believable, it&apos;s only the final one that feels too nice for the monster it&apos;s meant for.\n\nCharlie Clouser&apos;s score still uses that iconic theme at the end, which will honestly never get old at this point and before then it still avoids going unnoticed. As the first half is mostly trap free the score itself is nicer and more laid back.",
