    "reviewBody": "This was an incredibly silly and fun movie that you really don&apos;t have to think too hard about.\n\nThe humour is arguably the best part of the film, and I had many laugh out loud moments. Nicholas Hoult delivers as our lead, Awkwafina plays exactly what you&apos;d expect which suits the role well, but Nicholas Cage as Dracula is just fantastic. He hit the tone perfectly with this one, scary, funny, manipulative, honestly the perfect casting for this horror comedy.\n\nIt&apos;s not a perfect film, the action; whilst enjoyable, is at times incredibly difficult to follow exactly what us happening - which is a problem with a lot of movies now days. They&apos;re also some silly plot holes, as well as just not enough as Nick Cage as you&apos;d like, but overall it really doesn&apos;t matter.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for a horror comedy with some very gory and silly moments, you&apos;ve come to the right place. Fans of Cage are going to love this one.",
