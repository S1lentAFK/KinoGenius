    "reviewBody": "Sharper didn&apos;t fail to entertain me. A perfect movie for a good evening in front of the big screen with a well written screenplay that keeps you interested in the story, and although it&apos;s a tiny bit predictable, well at least to me, it was still a good suspenseful mystery crime. It&apos;s about born con artists, about greed, about deception and betrayal, all good ingredients to make a decent movie. The acting was top and not only by the most famous actors. Everybody was believable with their performances and that&apos;s the main reason to watch this movie. The cinematography looked very professional. I wasn&apos;t expecting much of Sharper so I was pleasantly surprised.",
