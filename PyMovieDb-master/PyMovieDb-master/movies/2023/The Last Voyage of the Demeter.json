    "reviewBody": "The only other Dracula movie I&apos;ve seen was the original 1931 movie while I was in class, though I was barely paying attention to it, so...\n\nAnyway, this movie was pretty decent and it was enjoyable for what it was. (I got the theatre all to myself, which was fun, but I forgot how big and salty a large bag of popcorn was, so that may have ruined it for me) The acting was fine, the characters were at least mildly interesting, I liked the costumes, and the tension was decent as well.\n\nI do think that Woody Norman did pretty well, his character was probably my favorite overall lol\n\nWhat confused me a little is that the characters were a bit stupid?? So, Dracula is on the ship (though I don&apos;t think they know it&apos;s him yet), killing people on the ship, they don&apos;t decide to search the crates until later in the movie, and in the middle of the night at that?\n\nHowever, the movie did manage to get me slightly sad during one of the scenes, which is good because I usually get mad at movies instead of sad.\n\nI&apos;d try to give it a watch if I were you but don&apos;t expect a cinematic masterpiece or anything like that.",
