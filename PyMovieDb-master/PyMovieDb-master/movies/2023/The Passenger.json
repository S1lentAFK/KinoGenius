    "reviewBody": "This little gem packs a powerful punch with realistic acting that evokes emotions that could only be felt in such a situation. The pacing and directing was perfect, and thanks to the multi-layered performances, I was never bored. Rough, rugged, and real, it reminded me of something from the 70s golden period of cinema. Like a small artsy film in which a young Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman would have excelled in the role. Maybe we&apos;re seeing a start to a new golden age of cinema? Let&apos;s hope so. This film is pure art, and imo best of all, it does not attempt to appease or compromise to any politically correct criteria.",
