    "reviewBody": "I wouldn&apos;t be as disappointed if I wasn&apos;t scammed into going out of my way literally to watch a movie that claimed to be a psychedelic soundscape which was instead a collection of 4-5 music videos and then a budget burning live performance video in some old ruins. It wasn&apos;t that Travis Scott is a bad performer, though there were some sequences during the performance video that I literally started laughing in the theatre because I didn&apos;t understand how I ended up here. It&apos;s the fact that reading the logline for the film is a complete misconception for what the video actually was. My friends and I were scammed to think this classifies as a film and I would love to hear what Gaspar Noe, Harmony Korine and Nicholas Weinding Refn have to say about calling it that. Anyway wow. I&apos;ve never rated a film this low but if we&apos;re calling it a film then it&apos;s a 1. I hope they never do that again.",
