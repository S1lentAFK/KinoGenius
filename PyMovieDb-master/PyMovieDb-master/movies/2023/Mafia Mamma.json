    "reviewBody": "Monica Bellucci and Toni Collette are absolutely delightful in Mafia Mamma. When I saw the trailer for this film, I knew it was going to be a fun ride and definitely did not disappoint. There was a couple of flat moments, but the rest was jam packed action and tidbits of gore.\n\nIt&apos;s probably not a film I would bother watching again though. It is like a once off enjoyable flick, but nothing I would put on my DVD shelf and turn to for a laugh.\n\nIf you want a fun film, like some action and comedy. Then it is well worth checking out. Like I said the two leading ladies performances definitely make it worthwhile.",
