    "reviewBody": "A very predictable thriller made unwatchable by terrible script and emotionally erratic performances. Whatever sense of dread was aimed for was undercut by wildly inconsistent tone. It was impossible to believe in any of the characters ultimately, which made all the plot machinations more annoying than threatening. Made me think the sole reason for its conception was the filmmaker passed through Oregon coast and thought it would make an interesting setting. It didn't.\\n\\nHowever, I highly recommend visiting the the coast, especially in the off season: rugged cliffs, sand dunes, good seafood, lots of lighthouses.",
