    "reviewBody": "If you wanna see a hot young beautiful girl shaking her bootie (and not in a vulgar way) go ahead and watch the movie!Jessica alba&apos;s character is way to innocent and a bit fake...I mean how can a girl like that , dressed like that could walk alone at night in a neighborhood like that...and what about Michael... how can that person could actually be successful...To me the only two things that are worth watching are the dancers ( a plus for Jessica alba) and the scenes with Missy Elliot!!But anyway it&apos;s really frustrating you have to write at least 10 lines...I&apos;m running out of ideas...In conclusion go to the movie if you want because who knows...maybe you would like it.",
