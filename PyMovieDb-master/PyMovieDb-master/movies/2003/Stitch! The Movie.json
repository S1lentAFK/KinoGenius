    "reviewBody": "While Lilo & Stich is an endearing saga, the Stich: the Movie isn't. Almost all the bits of the original is back, but it is so much flatter, so much less artistic, so much less well-paced.\\n\\nMy wife, who loved L & S, fell asleep while watching it and for anyone that has not seen the first L & S-film it must be utterly incomprehensible.\\n\\nAnd even the animation feels rougher, and it sure lacks the deep feelings and suspense of the original, in short a typical low-budget follow-up, that supposedly links the real film with the TV-series (which I have not seen).",
