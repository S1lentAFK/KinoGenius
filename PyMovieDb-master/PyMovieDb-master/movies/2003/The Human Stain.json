    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m terrifically surprised at all the middling reviewing of this film, to the point where I feel I have to echo the last few reviews that stand in opposition.\\n\\nThis is a film that just does it right. Unlike so many other dramas with heavyweight casts, this really feels like it&apos;s about the story, not the work. Kidman, aside from slipping into her native accent on a handful of words, is fantastic -- perhaps her very best. Harris, like Streep and maybe two or three other actors, brings a real humanity to a role that any other actor would just fill out.\\n\\nBut most of all, everything is in the background and hence subservient to the story. The gorgeous lighting, scenery, dialog -- the whole craft of the film is done the way it&apos;s supposed to be done, in the damn background. That all said, I think the real reason this film is slighted is because it&apos;s a little too good for the average viewer. It doesn&apos;t live up to their idea of what a lit-cum-drama is supposed to feel like. I just have a feeling that in several years this will be revisited and appreciated much more. Now, I&apos;m going to go watch it again!",
