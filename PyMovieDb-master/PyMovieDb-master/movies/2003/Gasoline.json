    "reviewBody": "Yeah, what everyone says about Bruce Willis is true. He&apos;s barely in it and he just mumbles answers to Luke Wilson basically. Serves no purpose other than to say Bruce Willis was in this. The last few years this is the type of movie he does. Low budget, bad script that he&apos;s in only for a couple days work and a big pay day. What a terrible way to end a once great career.\\n\\nBut make no mistake, Luke Wilson was only in this for a pay day as well. He&apos;s incredibly one-dimensional and boring. Just gets tiresome watching him be the bad cop and spew the annoying lines he&apos;s given here.\\n\\nBut then you&apos;re left with the lead actor, who can&apos;t carry a movie. I don&apos;t know him, I didn&apos;t like him and I don&apos;t care what happens to him. He&apos;s trying to solve the crime he&apos;s being accused of but it&apos;s a hard watch. It&apos;s a seriously boring and cliched script. You wonder where they got the money for Wilson and Willis to be in this?\\n\\nHow does this get made. I made it 45 minutes in and had to stop, I was so bored. But 45 minutes in this travesty should get me some sort of award.",
