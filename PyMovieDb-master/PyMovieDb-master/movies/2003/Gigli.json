    "reviewBody": "This was one laughed at movie. Jokes abounded on how astonishingly bad Gigli was. Is it true? The advance word on this film was so vicious that I had to see for myself if it's as bad as its early reputation suggested. The verdict: Gigli doesn't live up to (or should that be down to?) its hype. The worst film of all time? Give me a break. Gigli isn't even the worst film of the summer, and won't come close to the year's Bottom 10 list. I'm not going to defend the movie. I don't recommend it and, for the most part, it's an example of inept filmmaking, but it is watchable. I have to wonder if those who are coming down so hard on the motion picture have a secondary agenda. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are adequate- not Bogart/Hepburn but not too terrible either.",
