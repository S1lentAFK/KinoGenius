    "reviewBody": "Dark Blue was one of those movies I saw the trailer for back when it was first coming out in theaters that I had always wanted to see. For one reason or another I put it off and I eventually forgot about it. Over time some fellow film fans said this was worth watching and deserves a look. Kurt Russell&apos;s character is mean and lovable. He&apos;s a dirty cop, but we&apos;re with him every step of the way. There is a little bit of Training Day in this but one could argue Dark Blue is dirtier and angrier. This is not a typical character for Kurt Russell, and it&apos;s one of his best films from the past 10 years. I was surprised I hadn&apos;t seen this back when it came out. If you love Kurt, action films, and cop stories than Dark Blue is for you. Overall a good movie.",
