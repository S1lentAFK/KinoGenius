    "reviewBody": "Being that I grew up watching party of five, I never could&apos;ve pictured Matthew Fox (the good-looking older responsible brother in POF) being a psychopath but I felt he played the character well.\\n\\nWas it a blockbuster, no but it still held my attention. Maybe that&apos;s because I didn&apos;t have any expectations going in as I never read the books. Bottom line is, I was entertained and have seen far worse.",
