    "reviewBody": "I truly enjoyed this movie. It really isn&apos;t as bad as most of the reviews I&apos;ve read make it out to be. It was not horrible or a waste of time. I rented it first and liked it so much I bought it. I&apos;d recommend it for anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi movies for their entertainment value. I haven&apos;t read the book, so I can&apos;t make any comparisons. I think the whole story came together smoothly. Overall the acting was good, however Paul Walker would probably benefit from a few more classes. Gerard Butler was awesome in his role as Marek. I have a feeling we&apos;ll be seeing a lot him in the future (no pun intended). I loved the beginning, the end, and everything in between. I give it a strong 8.",
