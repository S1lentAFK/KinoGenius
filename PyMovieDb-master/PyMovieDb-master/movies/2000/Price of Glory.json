    "reviewBody": "I was lucky enough to catch this in the theatres twice. It's a great boxing film that not only deals with the glamours of boxing but also with the dark business side of it. When it was first released it was underrated and poorly promoted. Definitely worth a rental. Touching storyline and great action sequences.",
