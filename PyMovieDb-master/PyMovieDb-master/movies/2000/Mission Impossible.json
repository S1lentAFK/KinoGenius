    "reviewBody": "I really liked this one. Not very much in common with the TV-series, and I can see why so many dislike it that way. But there are some REALLY good sequences here, and there is even one that I consider to be one of the very best and most suspenseful parts of any movie - the part where Cruise is in the vault. Beautiful and nerve-racking.\n\nNot much else to say, though - it&apos;s an action movie, and it&apos;s a good one.",
