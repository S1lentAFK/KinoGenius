Acting is done much better in Love & Basketball.\\n\\nIn all, one the worst of 2000. While the movie was profitable, the budget was relatively miniscle.\\n\\nStay away from the strikes unless absolutely necessary, it almost asurredly will disappoint.\\n\\nRating: 2\\n\\nViewed: in theatre (Scope)",
