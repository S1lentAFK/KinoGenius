    "reviewBody": "I first saw this movie at my cottage in 2001 because my little cousins begged to rent it. I groaned because it looked like any other Family Channel movie with cheesy lines, etc. However, I was very wrong. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was recently advertised to be shown on TV again, and I felt nostalgic about it. But, I couldn't help thinking that since I was about 13 when I first saw it, my tastes might have changed, and I would hate it now. Again, I was definitely wrong.\n\nThis movie can appeal to any age group, because it has plot lines involving a wide range of ages. All the plot lines offer something funny and cute, even if sometimes unbelievable. But with a movie like this, you have to be able to suspend your grasp on reality for a couple hours.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, light movie to pass some time with, you will not be disappointed by this one. I recommend it to anyone.",
