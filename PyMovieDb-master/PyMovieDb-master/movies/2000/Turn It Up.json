    "reviewBody": "The movie was decent. But Pras lacks acting ability, which really dragged the movie down some. His total, straight face, no emotion performance was needed during a few scenes but the rest of the movie he needed to show some kind of emotions or at least facial expressions which were not there. Ja Rule did a great job in his first role and had some great lines to work with. Worth renting but not buying.",
