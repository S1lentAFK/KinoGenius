    "reviewBody": "I had some low expectations going into this movie. Sure..I watched and liked the other highlanders, but this is the 4th one, so it is bound to be dumb right? Wrong! I actually liked this movie. Sure at some points it makes no sense, but after you watch it and talk it over with someone, everything comes together. Now I don&apos;t recomend this to anyone who has not seen any of the other Highlanders. Those people will be very lost. Before you diss this movie...make sure that you see the director&apos;s cut. I have not seen the theatrical cut but Ii have heard that is sucks. So, I recommend that you skip the theatrical and go see the director&apos;s.. It has good action..good plot...and it ties two highlander&apos;s together..which is cool. Plus, the villain in this highlander is actually cool. The one in 3 was just a copy from the one in 1. Anyway..I would suggest this movie to fans of the series, but remember to see the director&apos;s cut. I don&apos;t think that you will be disapointed. 8.5/10",
