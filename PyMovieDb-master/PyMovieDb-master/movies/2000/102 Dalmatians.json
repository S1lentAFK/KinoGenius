    "reviewBody": "the first film was interesting for Glenn Close. the second - for Gerard Depardieu and for the strange effect of Big Ben. but the difference is too small. because it is a family film, with adorable puppies, with same adventures and new characters/cast, not convincing but amusing, chain of adventures and chaotic - hilarious events, with the predictable end and a lot of fun. so, nothing surprising. but nice for the good intentions. and for the joy to discover a colorful universe. for the remind of Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. and for the memories about the first part. so, a nice movie. not great, not special but useful for a rainy afternoon.",
