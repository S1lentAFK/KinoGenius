If you haven't watched it in years (as I hadn't), watch it again and you'll also see what I mean. It's raunchy, it's outrageous, and it's not PC, at all. Jim Carrey is excellent value, and is hilarious. And as an added bonus, Renee Zellweger has never looked better. If this is your type of thing (as it is mine), check it out.",
