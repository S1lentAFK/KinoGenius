    "reviewBody": "This is a pretty good film and I think it hits perfectly the things we all want in life. Great friends and significant others. It is just a beautiful film which I must say (for a comedy) and a Ben Stiller film is pretty jokeless. Good acting, good directing a good story and good everything. There was one thing that was great though. The way Edward Norton used Faith in this film. Never have I seen so much depictions of Faith in a film and actually enjoyed it. I don't believe in church and stuff, but these two clergymen are way beyond cool, they ROCK!\n\n7 out of 10\n\nNote: this review has been amended to remove some sexist comments I included at the time. Apologies for any offence caused. I was young and stupid at the time, thinking I was being 'cool'.",
