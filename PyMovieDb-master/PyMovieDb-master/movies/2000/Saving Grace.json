Saving Grace is smart and enjoyable - those who feel offended by the marijuana thing better go see the America's bride sort of movie.\n\nSaving Grace also shows that a funny movie doesn't have to be stupid. I was laughing my ass off during most of it but also pondering questions about what was the female lead character supposed to do to pay her deceased husband's debts.\n\nIn a nutshell - a witty storyline with typical English humour and good acting and directing. You couldn't ask for more.\n\n7/10.",
