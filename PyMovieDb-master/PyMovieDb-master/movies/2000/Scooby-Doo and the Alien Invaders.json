    "reviewBody": "I love Scooby-doo & like most i grew up watching him & the Awesome mystery team & i found the best of the Scooby-doo direct-to-video movies are, Zombie Island & The Witch&apos;s Ghost & The Alien Invaders, Those three earlier movies had the best animation in my opinion & the colours pop off the screen with vibrancy.\\n\\nThere&apos;s a cosy Nostalgic feel to just getting cosy & making a nice cup of coffee & watching a Scooby-doo movie. The best three movies of the whole franchise are the first three made by a Japanese animation studio which are: Zombie Island, The Witch&apos;s Ghost & Alien Invaders. The Ultimate Scooby-doo Trilogy.\\n\\nI had a dvd boxet with those three together & watched them all countless times. Love them.\\n\\nI liked the old fashioned B-movie vibe of this movie & the Awesome B-movie music that accompanied & made the atmosphere feel exciting & full of mystery.\\n\\nScooby-doo & the gang get mixed up with a mystery involving Aliens & that&apos;s all you need to know .\\n\\nSimply a great Scooby-doo animated movie.\\n\\nI definitely recommend: The Witch&apos;s Ghost, Zombie Island, Camp Scare, Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog.",
