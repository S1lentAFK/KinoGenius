    "heading": "A low-key caper film that hits the spot",
    "reviewBody": "This movie, like most caper films, builds slowly to a pretty satisfying conclusion. The three main stars are likable, and of course Paul Newman is a jewel as always. Linda is not as seductive as in some of her roles, but is,as always, a pleasure to watch. Some younger folks might find this too slow, but more mature audiences will probably enjoy it",
