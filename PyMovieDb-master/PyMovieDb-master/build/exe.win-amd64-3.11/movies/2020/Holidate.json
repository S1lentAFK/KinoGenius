No it was not an Oscar winning movie but I thought it was cool and enjoyed it. I thought everything about it was good in sense of acting, storyline, chemistry, characters all the way to the cinematography. I passed an hour and a half pretty good. Lol why the guy was Aussie I don&apos;t know but who doesn&apos;t love us Aussies lol all in all enjoyable movie and haters again get over yourselves and stop taking yourselves so seriously it makes YOU boring not the movie",
