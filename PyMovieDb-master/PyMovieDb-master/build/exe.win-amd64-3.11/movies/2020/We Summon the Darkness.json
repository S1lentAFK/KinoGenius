    "reviewBody": "Teen slasher with not enough slashing. Three teen girls meet three teen boys at a metal concert, and they take the party to a remote farm-house. Meanwhile, there are news stories about satanic murders being blamed on cults. Pretty straight forward plot. The twists that occur are very easy to see coming. Nothing was reinvented with this movie. Nothing clever occurs throughout, though there is some intermittent suspense. You know what is going to happen at every beat, but there are still one or two thrills as you get there. The production values are not bad, and at least it is shot well. But the dialogue is very poor, and much of the character interactions are not credible. The ending was also profoundly stupid. Overall, disappointing. I probably won&apos;t choose to see this again, but if it&apos;s on TV, I might not change the channel.",
