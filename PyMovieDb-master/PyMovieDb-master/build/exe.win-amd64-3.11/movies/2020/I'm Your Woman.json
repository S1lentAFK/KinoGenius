    "reviewBody": "Love Rachel Brosnahan and couldn&apos;t wait to see this. I don&apos;t need lots of action to find a movie satisfying but this one was just too slow, ponderous, and unnecessarily long, for my taste, though it did pick up toward the end. Guess I will just stick to Mrs. Maisel for my Rachel Brosnahan fix.",
