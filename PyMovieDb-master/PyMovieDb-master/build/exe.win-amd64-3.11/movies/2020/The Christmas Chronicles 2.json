    "reviewBody": "The thing with Christmas Day is that my wife absolutely wants to watch a Christmas movie. I remember watching the first Christmas Chronicle and it was passable. This sequel on the other hand is much too cheesy for adults to watch. I&apos;m 53 by the way, so 45 years too old to be able to enjoy this kind of movies. But I get it that kids will like this movie, it&apos;s well made and it&apos;s magical for kids. But I&apos;m not a kid anymore, so watching Darby Kamp and Jahzir Bruno during almost two hours is just too much for me. Those two kids are cringing to watch, I almost had to get my vomit bucket, it was that bad. So in résumé, if you want your offspring to shut up for a couple hours then this is the right movie to do so, but other than that I don&apos;t see the point of watching this as a normal adult.",
