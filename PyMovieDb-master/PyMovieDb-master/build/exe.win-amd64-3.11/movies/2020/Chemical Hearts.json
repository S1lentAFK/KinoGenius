    "reviewBody": "It jumps ahead from the typical teenager romance and explores the reality of young love and heartbreak. I could relate so much on how they portrayed the confusion about being in love and about being someone that you aren&apos;t ready to be yet. If you are someone that easily cries watching movies, you should totally bring a tissue with you. Lili Reinhart&apos;s acting is flawless and the way she embraced the role of grace town is totally out of this world.",
