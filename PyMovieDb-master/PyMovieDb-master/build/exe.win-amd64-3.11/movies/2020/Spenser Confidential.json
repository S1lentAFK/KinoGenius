    "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re taking this more seriously than that you weren&apos;t paying attention. There&apos;s not a moment in this movie where they submitted any requests for you to think higher of this than a fun flick. Try judging it on that.\n\nIt was fun. For fans of die hard and such. Was it dark and depressing like many crime drama&apos;s? no. Was it stupid like most comedy crime dramas? no. Was it boring like most everything else? no.\n\nFun characters, with great people acting them, obviously. Alan arkin for god&apos;s sake. (but she stole the cake if we&apos;re honest) Plot was never slow. Setting is always engaging. Boston is just fun . . .",
