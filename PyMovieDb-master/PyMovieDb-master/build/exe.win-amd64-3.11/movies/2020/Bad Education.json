    "reviewBody": "I was uninterested in watching this movie, but thought I would give it a shot given that it&apos;s based on a true story. Allison Janney is amazing, Hugh Jackman delivers a great performance, Geraldine Viswanathan is stellar (as always), but the entire cast is great (truly). From the beginning the film tells the story in captivating and compelling ways. The momentum builds over the course of the hundred minutes. Edge of your seat storytelling. This could have been made into a miniseries. It&apos;s just that good. Do yourself a favor and see it.",
