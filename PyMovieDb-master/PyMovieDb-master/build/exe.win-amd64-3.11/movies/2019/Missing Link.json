    "reviewBody": "Oh, how utterly delightful!! The animation is interesting, different, and simply beautiful. What a wonderful story and great script! The film had so many hilarious (subtle) one-liners. Most of the humor was just naturally funny. I absolutely loved the characters and Hugh Jackman voiced Sir Lionel Frost to perfection.\n\nThis is a great action adventure for young and old. Director Chris Butler&apos;s directorial debut &apos;ParaNorman&apos; (2012) is one of my favorite animated films. Now, with only his second film as director, &apos;Missing Link&apos; will be added to my list of favorite animated films. This was sensational. I loved it!\n\nThe ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, and personally, I can&apos;t wait!!",
