    "reviewBody": "I knew I would love this movie, I&apos;ve been a dog lover my whole life but this story wasn&apos;t just about a dog named Enzo but rather about life and all the ups and downs we experience, the highs and lows, losing loved ones, hard relationships...and through it all dogs are always there for us to provide comfort, a friendly bark, to lend a paw, to make us smile even on our toughest days. I&apos;ll never know whether they pick us or we pick them it&apos;s just one of those things that&apos;s meant to be and you find each other along the way. They don&apos;t live as many years as we do, but they live a full life while they are here and each one has a story. Thank you for telling Enzo&apos;s story.",
