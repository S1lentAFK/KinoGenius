    "reviewBody": "The trailer is enticing, the names associated is even more enticing. I saw this only cos of Patrick Wilson. Stephen King&apos;s name wasn&apos;t suffice to pull me into this purgatory. It is directed by Vincenzo Natali, the guy who gave us Cube, an awesome thriller. In this film he takes the similar concept from his previous movie Haunter which is decent compared to this.\n\nThere is unnecessary repetitive scenes of a pregnant woman screaming, irritating scenes of blurred visions, 101 mins of jus grass swaying which gets repetitive n boring. Ther is absolutely no explanation. I used to think that only Victor Crowley cud smash a person&apos;s face/head with bare hands but u have to check out a scene in this film. In some scenes, the child&apos;s acting is weak. He is seen trying to control his laughter. Mayb he was laughing at the lousy plot.\n\nBetter films on similar concept : Farmhouse, Triangle (Melissa George) n Haunter.",
