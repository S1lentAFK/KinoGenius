    "reviewBody": "There&apos;s something about serial killers that we as an audience find undeniably fascinating. I don&apos;t really know what it is, other than putting yourself in a world that 99% of us will never come close to. Ted Bundy&apos;s story is among America&apos;s most notorious, vile, evil, and wicked. However, the film never dives deep enough to give the audience that type of reaction. And you can make the argument that doing so would be exploitive and off putting, and your more than likely right, but I expected to be more unsettled by Zac Efron&apos;s turn as Ted Bundy. The last 20 minutes are really well handled though, especially as Lily Collins&apos; &apos;Liz Kendall&apos; finally begins to invite us into her psyche, but perhaps all too late. Perhaps a story like this does ultimately work much better in a TV series/Documentary format. - i.e. the Netflix one earlier this year.\n\n6.4/10",
