    "reviewBody": "Sweet movie about an elderly couple with their own set of insecurities and obsessions. It was a little refreshing to watch an entire movie without all the vulgarity that is used in so many other films as part of the shock value. This wasn&apos;t the fastest moving film, but the acting was good and I&apos;d say they portrayed this particular generation accurately. I used to work with the elderly and much of this was spot on. I wish the ending had a few more details, but I think I got the main idea. Not the best movie I&apos;ve every seen, but it was still worth the time.",
