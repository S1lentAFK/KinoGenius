    "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re not afraid of spiders, this movie will probably not be scary at all to you. I&apos;m an avid fan of horrors and have become desensitized over the years but always looking for something different and always looking for gore. For me this movie really could have been made as a short. There is nothing horror about the first hour of this movie. I was settling on 4 stars until I saw the last 20 minutes and it made up for the bore the first hour gave me.",
