    "reviewBody": "I watched this at home on BluRay from my public library. When it first came out the title threw me, I don&apos;t like seeing movies of families fighting. But I didn&apos;t understand, this is about a family where mom, dad, brother, and sister are all wrestlers.\n\nIt is based on the true story of a real British family. Florence Pugh (who I found so good in the 2016 Lady Macbeth) plays the lead character, Saraya Knight, who longed to get a break and get into the WWE as a featured wrestler. When she gets the chance she finds out it is harder than she ever imagined, including leaving her home and family behind to train in the USA.\n\nAll of the first half-hour and much of the remainder is in England, as such it contains much of the uniqueness of British characters, British humor, and British mannerisms. Viewers who don&apos;t appreciate that may not enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it very much. There is a very nice story here and the actors bring it to life very well.\n\nOne of my favorite movies of 2019.\n\nEdit: I watched it again in March 2020, a really entertaining movie.",
