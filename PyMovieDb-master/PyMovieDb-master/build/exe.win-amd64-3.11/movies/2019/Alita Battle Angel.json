    "reviewBody": "I loved this movie! Alita: Battle Angel is my type of movie. I love the science fiction and the great action throughout the entire movie. It also has a very substantive story as a solid foundation. The setting is very grim but Alita&apos;s character is uplifting and gives viewers hope. I liked how Alita&apos;s story also involves a quest of finding out who she truly is. She finds herself in a world where she can be seen as somewhat ordinary. But she comes to find out that she&apos;s far from ordinary. She&apos;s an angel from heaven. I really enjoyed this movie and the story itself can be explained further in other films. I hope there&apos;s a sequel as the ending laid the framework for more films. This movie is emotional, action filled, and has intense action sequences. The creators of this film did a nice job of spacing out the action. They didn&apos;t rush into it and every battle scene was meaningful. I would definitely recommend this movie.",
