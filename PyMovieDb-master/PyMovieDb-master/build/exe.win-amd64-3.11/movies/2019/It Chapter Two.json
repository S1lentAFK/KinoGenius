    "reviewBody": "It was entertaining, but they seemed confused as to whether the movie was supposed to be horror or a comedy. Several scenes had the audience trying to laugh and then scream, practically in the same breath. For a 3 hour movie, they should&apos;ve better managed the emotional pacing of the film.",
