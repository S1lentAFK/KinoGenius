    "reviewBody": "This certainly isn&apos;t horrific, and neither is it thrilling as billed.\n\nIt is a bland attempt to create some kind of arty suspense film that fails.\n\nThe &apos;story&apos; (for what it is) is just a series of &apos;things&apos; that happen that have no context or sense with no relation to each other apart from being in the same space.\n\nGoing by the end credits this film has a massive crew - for what I have no idea.\n\nIn the end, it became tedious and intensely boring to watch.\n\nOne to miss.",
