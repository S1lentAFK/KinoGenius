    "reviewBody": "This film is a documentary-fiction hybrid. Other reviewers speak entirely from ignorance when they criticize the film for using the real people who the characters portray as the younger Iván and Gerardo.\n\nDepicting graphic sex is immaterial to quality visual storytelling. If you&apos;re sad you didn&apos;t get to see that, there are plenty of websites for that.\n\nIf you want an innovative, sensitive story of sexual and ethnic oppression, this film is it.",
