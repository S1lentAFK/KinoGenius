    "reviewBody": "This is just a FYI for all the wannabe directors and movie producers out there. If you do not have enough money for $200 professional squibs that explode on impact, do not have gun fights. Simple. Even in the 80&apos;s Dirty Harry had more believable shooting scenes. The lame slo-mo and the gun fights were no better than a high school drama production.\n\nOk, I can overlook a few things, lets move on to the dialogue. Just painful, every actor is incredibly bad.\n\n1 star for the scenery, which I get to see over and over and over again. I think people could purposely try to make a bad movie and it wouldn&apos;t be this bad. Asylum movies are better.",
