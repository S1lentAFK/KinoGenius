    "reviewBody": "This movie has redeemed the show it&apos;s based on... for now at least.\n\nLincoln finally gets a well written character arc, the songs are good, and the hero actually fights the villain, unlike in Sponge On The Run which disappointed me a lot.\n\nI put it on number 3 on my top 5 animated Nickelodeon Movies.",
