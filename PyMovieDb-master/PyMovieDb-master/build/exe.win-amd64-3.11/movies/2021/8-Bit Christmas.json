    "reviewBody": "What an amazing film, brought back so many memories watching this. I was born in 1973 so the 80s was a massive part of my childhood. I fell into computers going through the BBC Micro, Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 computers and experiencing several more. There&apos;s a fashion reference which instantly made me think of the bright fluorescent socks and you&apos;d never wear matching pairs.\n\nThere&apos;s going to be several parts throughout the film that&apos;s going to trigger some great memories for most that watch it who experienced those wonderful years. The music sets the scene in many places and the use of Obsession by Animotion is extra magical for me.\n\nI went in not knowing what to expect with a cast I&apos;ve never heard of, wondering if I&apos;d be switching it off half way through but was hooked until the end.\n\nThis is one of those films that&apos;s going to be a classic with the whole family.",
