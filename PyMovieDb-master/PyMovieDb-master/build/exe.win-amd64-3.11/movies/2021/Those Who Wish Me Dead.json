    "reviewBody": "Forensic accountant Owen Casserly goes on the run with his young son Connor. His D. A. colleague has been murdered by an assassin team, Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick Blackwell (Nicholas Hoult). He had uncovered high-powered political corruption. With no one to trust, he heads off to small town Montana where his brother-in-law Ethan Sawyer (Jon Bernthal) is a Deputy Sheriff. The assassin team catches up to him before that. His son Connor escapes and finds help from smokejumper Hannah Faber (Angelina Jolie).\n\nIn the old days, this would be a mid-level thriller which would come in and be forgotten in a week. Nowadays, it&apos;s a mid-level thriller on streaming that is soon forgotten after being released. It&apos;s a functional movie. It has a bit too much on Hannah&apos;s past trauma. She needs to connect with Connor a bit sooner. Pregnant Rambo is pretty dope. The good news is that most of the characters are pretty smart. There are no overtly stupid moves from these people. Even stupid moves have reasonable excuses. It&apos;s ok. Watch it and forget it.",
