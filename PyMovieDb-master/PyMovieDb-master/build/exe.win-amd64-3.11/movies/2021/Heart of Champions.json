    "reviewBody": "Im a sucker for sportsmovies. I was very interested in this movie since I did rowing when I was younger. But the movie just falls flat.\n\nThe dynamic between Alex and his father is interesting and the classic story of a team with potential but teamwork issues, works, but the romance seems to be a irrelevant parallel story with no purpose. The end makes absolutely no sense both in terms of character building and realism.\n\nReally wanted to like this movie, but it fails to deliver.",
