    "reviewBody": "As an avid watcher of documentaries, I found this one very well made and educational.\n\nIt was hard to watch, but powerful, the highlight on adults being promoters of hate and being bullies to kids, confirming that for many adults kids sports are not about the wellness of the kids, it&apos;s about feeding their own ego and thirst for winning\n\nThe fact that sports could make the difference between a kid attempting to kill themselves or live a healthy life should be enough argument to support transgender kids in sports. Instead of fighting for who should win a game or a match, it might be better to find common ground for these kids&apos; sake.",
