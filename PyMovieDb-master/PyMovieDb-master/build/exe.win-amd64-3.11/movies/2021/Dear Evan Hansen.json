    "reviewBody": "As someone who loved the show on stage (3 times), the film is especially disappointing. While the play had vitality and humor to balance it&apos;s deeply moving content, nearly every scene in the film leans into the mournful tone until the highs and lows become one long low.\n\nAnd while the characters on stage were flawed people barely struggling to keep it together, Platt, Moore and Adams all seem oddly self-possessed.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen it on stage, please do.",
