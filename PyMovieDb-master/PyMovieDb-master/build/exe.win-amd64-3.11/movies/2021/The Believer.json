    "reviewBody": "Exorcist The Believer Rating 2.7/5 Horror, Thriller\n\nThey completely missed the essence of the original 1973 film, The Exorcist.\n\nMost of the people in the theater were elderly. Maybe they were excited because it had a sequel, but it mostly ended up being disappointing. It was cheesy watching the two kids being exorcised. There was no thrill. It felt like being on a roller coaster that only goes straight without any ups or downs.\n\nThough the cinematography was decent, it helped in preventing the movie from being boring. The acting was okay but nothing special. There were some jump scares due to loud sound effects. But overall, it lacked the thrill and terror you expect from a horror movie. That&apos;s why people watch horror films, to be scared. At least it wasn&apos;t as ridiculous as The Nun, where the monster gained powers in the end. ðŸ˜…",
