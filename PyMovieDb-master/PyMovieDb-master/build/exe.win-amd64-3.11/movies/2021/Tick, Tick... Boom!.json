    "reviewBody": "For me this movie doesn&apos;t take any time to hook the viewer. As soon as Andrew Garfield start singing, i already got in to the movie.\n\nThe story was quite fast to catch but give it more effort and you&apos;ll be there. Me personally got a little loose in the middle of the movie, but doesn&apos;t take to much time to get back at it again.\n\nAll i can say that Andrew Garfield is in his element, and you&apos;re gonna see a really great performance.",
