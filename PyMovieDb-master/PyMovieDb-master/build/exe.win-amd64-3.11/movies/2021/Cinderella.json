    "reviewBody": "Aesthetically speaking, this is my favourite Cinderella re-make. It&apos;s so pleasing to the eye, I adore the dress, the scenery, everything is just so perfect. It&apos;s an absolute visual delight. My favourite Cinderella re-make, in general, though, is Ever after with Drew Barrymore. I can never get tired of re-watching that one. Whereas this one, I would watch for the aesthetics, which I simply adore. In my opinion, the storytelling could have been stronger in this one, they could have added more comedic, mystery elements etc ...something to make it a little different (just as Ever-after did). Unfortunately, it doesn&apos;t stray that much from the original animated Cinderella and having some sort of twist or a different interpretation/ other elements added to it would have made this film more interesting and elevated it to a whole other level. I still recommend it, however, if simply for the aesthetics alone, it&apos;s a live animation that&apos;s absolutely beautiful to watch. It would have been lovely to have seen this in the cinema - on the big screen - it&apos;s gorgeous.",
