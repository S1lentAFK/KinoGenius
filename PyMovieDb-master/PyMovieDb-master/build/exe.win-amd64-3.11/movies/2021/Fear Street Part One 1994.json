    "reviewBody": "You&apos;ve gotta be kidding me.\n\nThis movie has fun, a little surprises, however, I would suggest not to exceed your expectations before watching this movie. I&apos;d been waiting to watch it for some time since it was announced by Netflix. It is, yet another, dark horrifying slasher. Haven&apos;t we watched the same again and again? This movie does have good fun though, you could enjoy it to some extent. Above Average. That&apos;s What a very good slasher movie can ho upto.",
