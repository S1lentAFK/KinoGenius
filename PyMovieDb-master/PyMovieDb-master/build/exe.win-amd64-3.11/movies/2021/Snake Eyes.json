    "reviewBody": "I saw this mainly cos of Iko Uwais n got terribly disappointed cos his footage is less n he doesnt get to kick ass.\n\nThen i thot lets just enjoy the action but then again none of the fight scenes are noteworthy.\n\nRecently i saw Lee&apos;s Fist of Fury n i loved the Japanese garden. This movie too has some some beautiful gardens, lakes, hill tops houses, etc.\n\nThe editing ruined everything.\n\nCos of the shaky cam n fast cut editing, one cannot make out what is going on during the fight scenes.\n\nThe character of Snake Eyes is more spiteful n the character of Shadow Storm more sympathetic.\n\nHow conveniently the clan n the Major Scarlett work together with Baroness, a Cobra member.\n\nAlso how easily Snake Eyes forgives his dad&apos;s murderer n after that fight alongside Baroness inspite of knowing that Cobra gang gave the orders to eliminate his dad.\n\nI miss those old ninja movies man.",
