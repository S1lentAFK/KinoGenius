    "reviewBody": "Not a big-budget animated masterpiece, but something you can learn from and enjoy. I watched this with 2 kids aged 7 and 9 and they keep talking about it, the facts they learned and what they already knew, how the title says &apos;back&apos; twice, and how we&apos;re all beautiful. They actually laughed out loud, were surprised by some parts, and stuck till the end. To me, this movie was a reminder of Steve Irwin and the glory days of National Geographic. It may not be great for extremely tiny kids, but it&apos;s a fun watch for everybody else.",
