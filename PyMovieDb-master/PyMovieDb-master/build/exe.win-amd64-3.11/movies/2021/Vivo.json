    "reviewBody": "Went through the users who gave it a 1* and saw that they are avid Disney fans. If you don&apos;t like animated movies not done by Disney then don&apos;t watch and stop dropping the average on IMDB. I found vivo fantastic and supper cute. The animation is awesome, how is the animation mediocre if it was done by the Oscar winning company that did spider verse. It&apos;s a style like everything else, if you only want princess stick to Disney.\n\nThe songs were some of my favorite as well, reminded me why Lin is the best at music making.\n\nThe story made me cry at the end. The only thing I didn&apos;t like was the drum song, but everything else was fantastic. Would recommend to everyone.",
