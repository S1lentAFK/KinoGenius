    "reviewBody": "Gripping, not uninteresting but boring. I was really deceived by this drama, I don&apos;t know why. Sean Penn is awesome but the rythm is so slow and the topic flat doesn&apos;t seem to convince audiences, at least I was not. I expected something really different, many Sundance festival movies were more excitng than this feature. Sean Penn has given us much more quality. But it remains something worth seeing though, not a garbage material.",
