    "reviewBody": "Don&apos;t waste your time. Trashy, predictable, horrible. I like some parts though. The storyline is funny and makes you laugh but the wife&apos;s acting is not good. The movie is filmed in two houses and a backyard. They could&apos;ve done better. A lot of great actors but it just felt flat.",
