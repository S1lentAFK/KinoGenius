    "reviewBody": "In the case of this movie, the Oscar was well deserved. The film was nominated in the wrong category, though (&apos;Best Foreign Language Film&apos;). It should have been up for &apos;Best Picture&apos;, &apos;Best Original Screenplay&apos;, &apos;Best Director - and it should have won all of those. As far as I&apos;m concerned, this may very well be the finest film on the subject of war - or conflict in general - that was ever made. I&apos;ve never seen anything similar; this film manages to show so many aspects of war, of human nature; it somehow manages to capture the essence of something that is inexplicable. Truly one of a kind and a must-see. And don&apos;t think for one second that this is some pretentious drivel or slow art-house fare - this is very much the opposite. 10 out of 10.",
