    "reviewBody": "A fairly bad movie that feels like it was written by a teenager with no knowledge or life experience.\n\nAnthony Mackie, though unimpressive, did a passable job, whereas I cannot for the life of me understand the casting of Damson Idris, who was fairly bad, having no presence on screen and seemed to be acting on auto pilot.\n\nThe writing was atrocious, seemingly trying to convey a message but falling short. The lead is supposed to have 56,000 hours of flight time which is also ridiculous, showing me how bad the writers actually are. 56,000 hours is 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, for over 6 YEARS...\n\nIn the end, it is a silly implausible movie that you will forget moments after you watch it.\n\nNot Recommended.",
