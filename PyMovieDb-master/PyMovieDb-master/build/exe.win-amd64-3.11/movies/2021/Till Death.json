I didn&apos;t think too much about it or expect great performances. I just went in for some light entertainment, and it was fine. I thought all the pieces fit together well enough. I don&apos;t think I would ever watch it again, and I don&apos;t disagree with anyone who wasn&apos;t into it, but I got some enjoyment from it.",
