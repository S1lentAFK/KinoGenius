    "reviewBody": "From the start you know you are in for a treat, especially for the fans of the musicals. Every song hits the chord, has catchy tunes. The production for this movie is mind-blowing, so many colors, brilliant choreography, exciting direction. The cast is fantastic all around, especially Anthony Ramos and Melissa Barrera shine in lead.\n\nOnly complaint will be the overly long running time. It is due to the many characters this movie is representing making it lose steam when focusing on less interesting characters. Still as the musicals go its one of the better ones.",
