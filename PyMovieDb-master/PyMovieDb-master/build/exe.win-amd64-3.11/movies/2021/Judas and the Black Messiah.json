    "reviewBody": "Both are based on the true story which happened in Chicago in 1968 and 1969, so two movies give the whole picture of what it was like in Chicago in late 60s. Social oppression, protest in reaction, police&apos;s excessive force of use, discrimination against the weaker are the words to describe atmosphere around that time. It&apos;s interesting to compare and contrast how Fred Hampton is realized in two movies. Other than that, there are many things to compare and contrast both contents and the forms.\n\n&apos;Judas and the Black Messiah&apos; is disappointing that the director could have done so much more with such an important historical figure (similar with &apos;The Trial of the Chicago 7&apos;). The screenwriting is stretched and elongated. The momentum and the tension have to be built up for December 4th Monroe Massacre where all the powerful emotions burst. However, the director fails not only to build up but also to have a great ending.\n\nP.S. History speaks that William O&apos;Neal is still a weak coward then and now.",
