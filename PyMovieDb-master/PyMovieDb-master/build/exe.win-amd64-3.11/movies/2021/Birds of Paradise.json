    "reviewBody": "Considering the amount of fodder on Prime video, I was expecting mostly filler and there was a point where I asked myself what the movie was actually supposed to be about?\n\nAnd did it rise above that and finally mean anything? No, it didn&apos;t, but I watched it all the way through and kept on hoping for something bigger and deeper, which is all you can ask for, even though you don&apos;t necessarily get it.\n\nBeautiful people, not too cheesy, some pretty good acting, a few good songs and mostly great presentation. The film didn&apos;t try too hard and I liked it for its simplicity and eroticism and for not handing everything out on a plate.\n\nAn entertaining watch that failed to hit major highs because the core story just isn&apos;t strong enough, but still classy and subtle enough to maintain a steady 7/10.",
