    "reviewBody": "This film is awesome and I can&apos;t wait to watch it again. It is purposefully designed so that watching it while high is going to be a experience(Ask how I know). It still manages to have a coherent plot and character arcs even though it is essentially a stoner film.\n\nThe animation is out there and while it might look a little cheap at points, at others it looks like a lot of work went in to make it happen(The Medusa Characters Snake Hair for instance had me mesmerized). Character design is great and I can remember each of the main characters pretty clearly.",
