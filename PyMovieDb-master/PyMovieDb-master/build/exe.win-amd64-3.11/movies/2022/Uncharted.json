    "reviewBody": "After seeing the trailers I was far from convinced on this movie but it is exactly what you would want to expect from a video game film!\n\nLoads of big over the top set pieces with some cool Easter eggs thrown in, I&apos;d imagine it&apos;s a much better cinema experience than a couch movie but well worth a watch and worthy of a sequel.",
