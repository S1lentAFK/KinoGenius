    "reviewBody": "Loved it. Everytime, I thought It would take an obvious turn, it didn&apos;t. It was funny, touching, fresh and watching the chemistry of Sigourney Weaver and Kevin Kline was off the charts. The acting, direction, production values were excellent. Movies of this genre have been rare in recent years . It was refreshing. It&apos;s a must see! The small town setting felt so authentic to New England, though shot in Nova Scotia.\n\nI found myself holding my breath in so many scenes. All of the characters felt very real and if you&apos;ve ever dealt with an alcoholic, many things might hit home. There are two adorable dogs in it too!",
