    "reviewBody": "Although it&apos;s a detective movie from the Bruce Willis series, you can tell that the production scale is much smaller. After watching this movie, it really feels like it&apos;s not as engaging as it should be. I&apos;d recommend streaming it online. It makes me miss the old Die Hard series of films, watching Bruce Willis and his partner team up to navigate large-scale scenarios, busy solving various puzzles set by the villains. Especially the famous 5-liter and 3-liter bucket puzzle to get 4 liters of water, and the international cybersecurity issue of the nationwide blackout by hackers. These smaller-scale problems seem confined to the petty crimes and personal grudges of small-time villains. It feels more like watching a TV series.",
