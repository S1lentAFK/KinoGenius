    "reviewBody": "This story was very touching and obviously the backdrop is incredibly important and powerful and has been and deserves to be retold over and over and over because of its historical significance and cultural relevance.\n\nMy issue here was in the execution - too many things that simply did not make sense or were far too overreaching . I also have a huge pet peeve in movies where people speak English with accents when they should just be 1. Speaking the native language in this case Polish or 2. Just speak English without an accent - what is the point of the accent ??? That&apos;s a general criticism of all movies that do that .\n\nSecondly I did not feel particularly connected to any characters and the acting was subpar. Thematically it had some good power and I was entertained - but there are SO many incredible Ww2 movies I would pick something else .",
