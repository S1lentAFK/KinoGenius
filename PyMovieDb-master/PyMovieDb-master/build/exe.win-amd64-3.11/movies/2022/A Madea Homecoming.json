    "reviewBody": "Madea....she&apos;s one crazy lady, my first ever time seeing the character, after watching this, I can&apos;t wait to see the other films.\n\nI do know Mrs Brown however, and the combination was somewhat surreal. What was going on with that makeup, those cheeks were well rouged up.\n\nIt&apos;s almost a pity that there&apos;s so much bad language through it, as this could be enjoyed by kids, if I were twelve I&apos;d have watched this over and over.\n\nIt is absurd, it&apos;s insanely absurd, but it&apos;s well meaning and well intentioned, with all that&apos;s happening in the world right now, sometimes it&apos;s just nice to escape into a world of silliness, and forget some of the world&apos;s horrors.\n\nTyler Perry is wonderful, and I really did buy into the humour.\n\nI&apos;ve chosen not to read other reviews, and I can only just imagine some of that comments, but take it for what it is, light hearted fun, 7/10.",
