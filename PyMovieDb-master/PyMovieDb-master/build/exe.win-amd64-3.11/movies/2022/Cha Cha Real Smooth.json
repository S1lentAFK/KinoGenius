    "reviewBody": "This is the sweetest, freshest, most genuinely heartfelt movie that I&apos;ve seen in ages.\n\nThe script is thoroughly original, warm and witty, and the story unfolds without a false moment or even a whiff of predictably. The direction is sensitive and assured, and the leading man is endearingly winning.\n\nIt blows my mind that all of these are the work of the same person: the 25-year-old Cooper Raiff.\n\nIf you are reading this, Mr. Raiff, bravo and congratulations! Whoever funded this film needs to give him more money to make more films.",
