    "reviewBody": "The first Dr. Strange stands in its own, even for just superhero movies. But this one is still enjoyable, especially if you are caught up with WandaVision and Loki.\n\nI don&apos;t understand the unreasonable level of hate for anything post-endgame other than Spider-Man (shocker). Sure there&apos;s a couple things people have pointed out that I&apos;ve noticed but the movie is nowhere near the suck-fest rabid fanboys insist it is. It&apos;s a fairly standard comic-book fare.\n\nI&apos;m not going to convince anyone this is the best MCU movie, I don&apos;t even think it is. But it&apos;s good and it&apos;s fun. Some Marvel fans are weird now, they have no ability to have any nuance in their opinion.",
