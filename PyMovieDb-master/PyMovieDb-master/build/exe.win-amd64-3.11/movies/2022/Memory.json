    "reviewBody": "Story of the encounter of two lonely, battered souls, searching for love, peace, acceptance and meaning in life. Told with class, cleverly avoiding cheap sentimentalism, treating viewers as intelligent breed. Scenes are woven together so that story runs smoothly, lightning is beautiful. Jessica is on top form, acting with her usual style, persuasion and expressing just what the story needs. Sarsgaard gets under your skin with ease and charm. Merrit Wever is again persuading with her detachment and minimalism, reasons revealed at the end.\n\nMovie that touches you deep, connects and lets you leave the theatre grateful for what it gives you. Highly recommended.",
