    "reviewBody": "I hate to give a great Animated movie like this a low score, but in the end it was the story that forced my hand. So let&apos;s give points where points are due. The Animation is GREAT! The acting was wonderful! But the plot was just awful. Look, I get that it&apos;s a movie directed at kids and what not, and no, I&apos;m not being too picky, the story just kinda falls apart towards the end of the movie. I felt like the writers got lazy towards the end. It&apos;s their laziness that prevents me for giving this movie a much more higher star count. But in the same time I admire them for trying. Seriously, it&apos;s not every day you see a great Animated movie, and a 2D animated movie to boot! I reward this movie 5 stars for the spot on Animation but only 1 star for the lazy writing. 5 minus 1= 4 stars, that&apos;s my final ruling on this beautiful film; take it or leave it.",
