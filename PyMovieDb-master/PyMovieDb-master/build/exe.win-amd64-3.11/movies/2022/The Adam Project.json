    "reviewBody": "The Adam Project is an adventurous film in the mould of Spielberg and other &apos;80&apos;s and 90&apos;s pics, meaning confused conversations, quick quips, great close ups and seeing the world from a child&apos;s point of view as well.\n\nThe plot is a time travel story where our main character meets his younger self, trying to fix the damage a villain inflicted, and that&apos;s all the narrative I&apos;ll share beforehand. It&apos;s well shot, well directed, well written, and well played, especially by young Adam.\n\nIt leaves us with an entertaining film that plotwise isn&apos;t surprising enough to elevate it to greatness, but a good watch nonetheless.",
