    "reviewBody": "The movie lacked severely in the category of focus...... I mean really... one of the guys gets his powers back that can electrocute a city block but he gets beat to death by a jailer? How? I mean rally how? No depth in scenery with regards to prison staff..... and can we take a second and agree the TV crew idea was an abysmal execution.\n\nThe ending was a fabulous surprise.\n\nAnd the holy executioner was cool.\n\nFor these 2 items they get 4 points. Director sucks though.",
