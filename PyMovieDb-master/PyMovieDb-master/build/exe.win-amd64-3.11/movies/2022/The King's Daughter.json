    "reviewBody": "If you are ok with a thriller with unique pacing you might enjoy this one. By unique pacing I mean that the director have you thinking one thing, mellow even relaxing you for a few minutes, and then BANG something totally strange happens. Then when you are getting used to the new situation, you are relaxed again, but then BAM, some new info that throws a totally different twist to the situation and that goes on almost in the entirety of the movie. I really liked that but I can see how people that might expect a formulaic Hollywood flick might find it odd.\n\nMy only criticism is that the ending is very predictable and there is no big thing to remember this ending by, I was also missing a good ending scene or maybe an epilogue. This is a non-spoil review so I can&apos;t reveal much more, watch and decide for yourself.\n\nNevertheless, The Marsh Kind&apos;s Daughter is an enjoyable watch, it is violent at times, but much less than the R rating might suggest, I would let a mature teenager watch it, but as a parent, make your own decision. The acting, which does not include any &apos;A-list&apos; actors, is still solid, and the lead actor (Daisy Ridley) and some other familiar faces like Gil Birmingham (NCIS) are doing a great job in making the script believable.\n\nOverall recommended for an evening watch. Exact score: 72 / 100.",
