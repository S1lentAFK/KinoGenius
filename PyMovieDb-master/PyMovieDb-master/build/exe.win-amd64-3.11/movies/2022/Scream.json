    "reviewBody": "After watching Scream 2022 (Scream 5), I&apos;m confused as to how critics and fans are rating this film a 9 or 10 out of 10. The 1st and 2nd act worked well, the 3rd act ruined it. The conclusion felt random and unearned. Certain intentions made no sense. I also didn&apos;t appreciate the writers pretty much asking the viewers to suspend logic while watching. Whoever is placing this entry into the #2 or #3 spot of the franchise is living in La La Land.\n\nThat said, this movie opens itself up to an interesting 6th sequel if written well. Bring Kevin Williamson back to write the entire script. Bring in some more humor. Surprise me with something original.",
