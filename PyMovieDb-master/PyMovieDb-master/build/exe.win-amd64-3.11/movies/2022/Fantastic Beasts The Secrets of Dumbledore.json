    "reviewBody": "Though the style part was enjoyable on it&apos;s own; the cinematography, special effects, costumes, score, set design and much of the acting was brilliant. It felt great to lose myself into the feel of the wizarding world again. But the plot and the writing felt unanchored in anything real or relatable. Nothing felt earned. Events just happened without much anticipation or appreciation of their significance, and I didn&apos;t feel invested much in any of the plot lines or characters. I&apos;m not expert enough to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but I know something did.",
