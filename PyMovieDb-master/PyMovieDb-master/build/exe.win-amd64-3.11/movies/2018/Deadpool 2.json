    "reviewBody": "I&apos;m not a huge fan of comic character movies even though I watch them all but Deadpool is definitely my favorite Marvel character. I guess it&apos;s because he&apos;s just a bit kinkier with his sometimes vulgar sense of humor. That&apos;s something you will never see in the other Marvel or DC Comics movies. Deadpool doesn&apos;t fit in that family package as his constant humor is just above the edge. I&apos;m normally not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds either but I have to admit that his Deadpool character fits him as a glove. About the story it&apos;s a typical superhero against evil like all other superhero movies but that little humorous touch makes all the difference. And for a sequel it&apos;s a good one, just waiting for a third one now.",
