    "reviewBody": "Pretty good movie visually and even though the changes from the book are obvious but they don&apos;t spoil it. They are changes that have to be made so it translates well on to screen. \n\nThe comedy in the film is charming and not over the top. It fits in well with the film. \n\nThe visuals are awesome. There are so many Easter eggs and references from pop culture it&apos;s unbelievable that they managed to add so many. It&apos;ll take a long time to spot them all. \n\nOverall I&apos;d say this film is definitely worth a watch.",
