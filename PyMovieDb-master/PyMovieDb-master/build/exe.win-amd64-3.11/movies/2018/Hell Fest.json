    "reviewBody": "This movie was entertaining enough for what it is... a slasher flick. I&apos;m not sure slasher type movies would ever earn 10 stars because there&apos;s usually not much acting, just a lot of screaming and running. LOL. \n\nHellFest was a good flick to see in the theater. The misleads were fun, the graphics and style reminded me of 80&apos;s horror. You don&apos;t expect to see an Academy Award winning movie, you expect to have fun. And this was a fun ride. \n\nI would recommend seeing this movie if you like campy, fun, slasher-horror movies. Not sure why it would only get 1-2 stars,...you saw the trailer and knew what to expect for the most part.",
