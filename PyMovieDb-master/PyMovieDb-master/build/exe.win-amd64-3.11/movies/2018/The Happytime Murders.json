    "reviewBody": "An interesting mix of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Team America: World Police that sometimes works and sometimes doesn&apos;t. This film doesn&apos;t pretend to be anything other than a raunchy comedy and doesn&apos;t hold back on the gross-out humor. Performances were a bit on the splotchy side and it&apos;s easy to tell the scenes where Melissa McCarthy is improvising vs. her scripted scenes. The actual puppeteering is very well done (I would expect nothing less given the involvement of Jim Hensons&apos;s son). Overall, the gimmick and little moments are more than enough to make up for the movie&apos;s shortcomings, making it very enjoyable, though still not any sort of masterpiece.",
