I know the formula and the headliners style of comedy so I knew pretty much what I was getting into.\n\nI laughed and found some rather sweet moments in the film. Say what you want about Kevin and Tiffany but they both STARRED in a PG-13 film that is fun, light and has some pretty important messages... it&apos;s never to late to accomplish anything and sometimes it really only takes that one person to believe in you.",
