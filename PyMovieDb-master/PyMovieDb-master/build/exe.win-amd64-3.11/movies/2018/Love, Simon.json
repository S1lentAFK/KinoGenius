    "reviewBody": "Here are my thoughts about Love, Simon:\n\nFirst, it was definitely the best movie adaptation of a book I&apos;ve ever seen. Hands down. It was also an extremely authentic story to begin with, and it translated so well as a movie.\n\nSecond, I wish this movie had been around when I was younger. The message of love and acceptance was so powerful, and the way Simon and his friends were portrayed was amazing. Kudos to the actors. The whole theater was cheering, laughing, and crying with them.\n\nRepresentation matters. Our kids need to see themselves on screen in movies like this.",
