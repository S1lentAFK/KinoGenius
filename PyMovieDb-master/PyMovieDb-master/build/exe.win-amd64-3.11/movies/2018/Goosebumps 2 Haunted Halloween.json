    "reviewBody": "The original Goosebumps movie took me by surprise when it came out in 2015. It had fun likable characters and a great villain in Slappy the evil dummy. \n\nFast forward 3 years and here&apos;s the sequel. 99% of the cast from the original is missing and the new characters aren&apos;t as interesting. They&apos;re serviceable but kind of forgettable. The story is also not as well paced as the original and is too fast for its own good coming in as a little too short. It needed about another 10 minutes or so in its last act.\n\nBut I can&apos;t hate it because it&apos;s still a lot of fun. Once again Slappy steals the show and there&apos;s some surprisingly creepy scenes involving him early on in the movie. The other Goosebumps monsters are fun too and the halloween setting puts a smile on my face. I also really dug the musical score by Dominic Lewis. \n\nIf you have kids I highly recommend taking them to this one. Although there might be a few scenes too scary for the younger ones it&apos;s the perfect horror movie for them to watch during the Halloween season. \n\nBuy a ticket, some popcorn and a soda and have fun.",
