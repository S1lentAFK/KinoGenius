    "reviewBody": "I am a 71 year old heterosexual woman and I loved it. It left me with a large lump in my throat so I went home to see what it was about. And big surprise it took me back to my high school years when I felt so frustrated, bored, trapped by the stupidity of what I was spending my days doing. Taking tests on regurgitated information that didn&apos;t interest me at all. I just cried the lump out that was a ball of similar feelings to the ones portrayed in the movie. This was outwardly worse and very poignant and it makes me understand why so many kids today are lost and angry. They are right to be angry. Who is caring for who they are- not who everyone wants them to be?\n\nThanks for your courageous movie. I think almost anyone could get something out of it.",
