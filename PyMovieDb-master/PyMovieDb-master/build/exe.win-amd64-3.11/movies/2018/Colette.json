    "reviewBody": "The tale of Gabrielle Colette is a fascinating one, as it turns out. I was completely unaware of her story before seeing the film, and emerged from the cinema feeling as though I had learnt a lot about this literary legend.\n\nKeira Knightley is remarkable in the title role. This is career-best form from her. She carries the film wonderfully. Denise Gough is also great in the role of &apos;Missy&apos;. The direction from Wash Westmoreland was also superb. He was able to successfully take the script, and deliver it in the best way possible.\n\nHowever, the film lets itself down from a weaker story/script where it constantly struggles to find and execute more positive moments from Colette&apos;s story. Instead, it focuses on the more gloomy moments from her life, leaving the happier moments sidelined. Some of the supporting characters lack depth, including: Eleanor Tomlinson&apos;s &apos;Georgie&apos; and Aiysha Hart&apos;s &apos;Polaire&apos;. These characters play an integral part in Colette&apos;s story, but, their lack of screen time, and the way in which they&apos;re written in to the story makes the characters have no real impact in driving the film forward.\n\nThis movie does have a few flaws which, overall, lets it down. But, it was still an enjoyable movie.",
