    "reviewBody": "I liked this movie for the honest approach it took to the times but didnt let that overshadow or even crowd the real message, which is - follow your dreams - or maybe - dreams CAN come true.\n\nAlthough my mother&apos;s parents were from Mexico, I knew nothing of the culture or hardships until about 10 years ago when I took a job in South Texas and an older man shared a few stories with me. It was eye-opening, almost unbelievable to hear how hard some people had it. But he didn&apos;t only share the hard times, they had happy times, as a family.\n\nSo thankful to the writers, directors & producers for keeping us focused on the dream and not making the movie all about pain.\n\nBecause I watch movies to be entertained, to take me away from everyday life and I love a happy ending. This is a light-hearted story of not getting sidetracked while following your instincts. Great acting, music was very nice, altogether a great movie.",
