    "reviewBody": "I had high hopes for this when I first saw the trailer and I&apos;m very glad I watched it.\n\nJennifer Lawrence was hilarious in this and you can tell she had an absolute blast making this. She stole every scene she was in and some of the delivery of her lines were brilliant. There were many funny moments throughout, some raunchy and some cringy but in a good way.\n\nWhat I wasn&apos;t expecting was there to be a few heartfelt moments so much so that it felt rather drama like. It didn&apos;t happen all that much so it&apos;s still a comedy but when it did happen, it sometimes worked with the story but other times felt like it was dragging abit.\n\nIs it as funny as other raunchy comedy&apos;s like superbad and the 40 year old virgin? No but it&apos;s definitely close to those. A must watch!",
