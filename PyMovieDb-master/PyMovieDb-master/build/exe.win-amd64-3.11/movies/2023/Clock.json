    "reviewBody": "Despite what some of the reviewers say...yes. There are some very insightful things that are addressed in the story. But it doesn&apos;t pay off in the end, in my opinion. It&apos;s a bit confused, i think...part of it a commentary on child bearing/rearing and part of it a horror story. But i don&apos;t feel the two blended well...maybe in two or three rewrites, but it felt like it was still a work in progress and found itself needing an ending which wasn&apos;t at all satisfying. Just a &apos;let&apos;s do this and get it over with&apos; type last act...the first two acts were enjoyable, though. And endings are difficult. But important.",
