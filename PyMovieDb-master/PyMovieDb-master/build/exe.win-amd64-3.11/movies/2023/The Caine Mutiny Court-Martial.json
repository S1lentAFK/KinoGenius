    "reviewBody": "I love the echoey, stark sound of the set....masterful. It shows how these things actually are on occasion. As a former military officer who sat on two courts martial, one was held in a small office, one was held in an actual courtroom that echoed eerily like this set.\n\nIt was refreshingly taut, and my gut was taut as well during the entire production.....bravo on that point. When these types of proceedings occur, people&apos;s lives are irretrievably altered...whether for good or ill.\n\nAnd the lack of music was awesome! Real life has no soundtrack......\n\nI thought the lighting was accurate, and the whole atmosphere felt like something large was going to happen....whether that was going to be good...or bad....we don&apos;t know....\n\nAs a lawyer, I was pleased that the objections and decisions by the court were pretty accurate.\n\nFinal verdict? We could all benefit from more productions in this sphere...well done.",
