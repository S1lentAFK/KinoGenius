    "reviewBody": "This is an excellent and original thriller in which we never know where it&apos;s going until the very end. I saw At the Gates at the Deauville film festival where the film received the most heartfelt and resounding standing ovation. The oppressive atmosphere and smart scenario make At The Gates a favorite of the festival.\n\nIn At The Gates, tension comes from what we don&apos;t see, or rather, from what we don&apos;t know. The film uses a cruelly efficient suspense to convey the dangers in the US today.\n\nThe lead actor Ezekiel Pacheco is a talent to watch. And the score by up and coming composer Julia Newman lasts with you after the film ends.\n\nThis is a gripping and smart mystery. The best I&apos;ve seen this year.",
