    "reviewBody": "The Unseen is quite literally the worst movie I&apos;ve ever seen. I was excited to watch since RJ Mitte is the star, but was immediately let down. RJ did the best he could with the horrible script he was given. Other than RJ and Candice Rose, the acting was atrocious. The writer also claims this movie was edited by the same person that edited Donnie Darko, but his name is no where to be found in the credits. Instead of wasting your time watching this film, I suggest watching Fish Jelly Film Reviews video on YouTube! It&apos;s only 26 minutes long and explains the whole film! It&apos;s extremely accurate unlike some of the reviews on here.",
