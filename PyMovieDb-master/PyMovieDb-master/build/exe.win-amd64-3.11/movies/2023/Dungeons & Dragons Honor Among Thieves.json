    "reviewBody": "Dungeons & Dragons is an absolute blast! I highly recommend seeing this if you haven&apos;t already. The storyline is fantastic, and the action is amazing. The cast is great, and some of the turns that you didn&apos;t expect makes the movie better. The humor in this is balanced on a perfect level between serious and humorous. Speaking of humor, every joke in this movie hits hard! This can definitely get a laugh out of ya. Some of the references in this movie definitely remind me of goofs from the actual Dungeons & Dragons game. They definitely nod into the lore throughout this. Overall, this is a good time if you wanna see some action and comedy!",
