    "reviewBody": "Fear is directed by James Foley and written by Christopher Crowe. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petesen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Thomas Kloss.\n\nOne of the number of psycho-sexual thrillers that surfaced in the 80s and 90s, Fear has the narrative hook that it involves teenagers. Witherspoon is the girl who invites drifter David McCall (Wahlberg) into her life, only to find he&apos;s as unstable as unstable can be. Director Foley and his team then produce a film that pretty much cribs from a number of other similar themed movies. All of the key scenes will be instantly familiar to genre film watchers, and unfortunately the plot twists and turns come as no surprise.\n\nHowever, in spite of the lack of originality in structure and narrative thrust, Fear is never dull, not even when Wahlberg is wistfully looking into Witherspoon&apos;s eyes like a love sick puppy. Suspense is on hand for the big finale, which unfolds with kinetic brutality, and it&apos;s also nice here to find that some thought has gone into the characterisations of those in peril. Kloss&apos; photography around the various Seattle locales is vividly appealing, as is Burwell&apos;s music compositions, while the acting performances are all on the good side of good, with nobody harming the balance of the piece.\n\nA teenage Cape Fear – cum – Straw Dogs - cum – Fatal Attraction, but good with it regardless. 7/10",
