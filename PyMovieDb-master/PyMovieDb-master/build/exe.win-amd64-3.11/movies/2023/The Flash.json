    "reviewBody": "The Flash is a goofy movie. Not only is it much lighter in tone than most of the DC Extended Universe, but it&apos;s also wildly uneven, unsuccessfully trying to balance dramatic moments with constant attempts at lowbrow humor. The computer graphics are shockingly bad and are, at times, reminiscent of 2004&apos;s The Polar Express. There are some genuinely dramatic parts, when Ezra Miller isn&apos;t mugging for the camera, and I&apos;d be lying if I said my childhood heart didn&apos;t surge with joy almost every time a Tim Burton&apos;s Batman reference was made, but The Flash was, for the most part, a disappointing fizzle.",
