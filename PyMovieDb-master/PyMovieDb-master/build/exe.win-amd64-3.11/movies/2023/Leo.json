    "reviewBody": "Just like his children&apos;s movies such as &apos;Bedtime Stories&apos; or any from the &apos;Hotel Transylvania&apos; franchise, Adam Sandler always brings a very endearing quality. His newest animated feature, &apos;Leo,&apos; portrays a class pet who shares his wisdom of the last 75 years, living through the decades in his final years. Leo brings a dignified heart to the movie. As he opens up, he can talk to students in the classroom who take him home as an assignment, helping them work through their personal problems and struggles of growing up. It&apos;s this kind of endearment that Adam Sandler brings to his children&apos;s movies that I am such a sucker for. Of course, I love his raunchy comedies and more adult flex, but every time I see Adam Sandler pursue children-related content, he always leaves a deep, profound message for children to identify with and learn from. Also, this movie is quite musical, which I found surprising at times!\n\nLong story short, this is the perfect movie for any child to help them understand life&apos;s hardships growing up. It can seriously help children develop their own confidence in facing the struggles they may encounter in this day and age. As I stated before, I wish Adam Sandler would commit to making more children&apos;s movies because he really drives meaningful messages that many other children&apos;s movies don&apos;t often tackle enough. I give Adam Sandler credit for this movie. While it&apos;s aimed at a much younger audience, there are things even adults can learn from this movie&apos;s perspective if watched with a childlike sense of heart. Definitely go check this movie out with your kids! It&apos;ll be a fun watch with a lot of important life lessons about self-esteem and being comfortable with who you are!",
