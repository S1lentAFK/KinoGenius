    "reviewBody": "After the first half hour of this movie, i thought it was going somewhere amazing, it was funny and clever and nic cage is just really good in the mane role.\n\nBut i don&apos;t think it did nt he 2nd half of the movie, it kind of faded out, and missed such a massive oppotunity.\n\nIt&apos;s still a good movie, but it completely went in a different direction in the last half hour than i thought it would. Which was just such a shame.\n\nSuch a missed oppotunity in my book, but still worth a watch. When the dreams turn darker i think there was such a great set up for a better last half hour or so. Shame.\n\nWorth watching but didn&apos;t reach it&apos;s potential.",
