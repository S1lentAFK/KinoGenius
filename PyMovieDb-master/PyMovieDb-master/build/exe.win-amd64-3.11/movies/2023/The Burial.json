    "reviewBody": "Acting is top notch and story is a great one. Integrity is worth everything - more than some ahole gigantic business owner is willing to pay. Absolutely worth watching as many stories are told Jamie Fox plays a lawyer with tons of money, but his heart is still in the right place. Tommy lee Jones is excellent as usual - great to see him in this movie.\n\nEnding is a bit predicable but still riveting and makes you believe that good will always win over evil.\n\nI highly recommend this movie because you&apos;ll certainly feel really good after watching it. Not all movies need to have violence and sex at the forefront.",
