    "reviewBody": "If you&apos;re looking for narrative, cohesion, plot structure, etc. Look elsewhere. Also, if you have had major mental health issues, or breakdowns this is your trigger warning.\n\nThe movie reminds me of a long, confusing nightmare. In dreams there are rarely beginnings, middles or ends. This movie explores the mental challenges of having a child. I&apos;m not a parent, but everyone&apos;s experience is different and has its own challenges. In this film, the baby crying (it starts quickly in the plot so it&apos;s not a spoiler) is, at least to me where the breakdown starts.\n\nOverall it&apos;s like watching a nightmare. Part horror, part character study, part surrealist, but overall it doesn&apos;t really come together. Some parts are interesting overall it&apos;s not a pleasurable film going experience.\n\nIf you&apos;re about to have a child or thinking of it I would not watch this movie. 5/10.",
