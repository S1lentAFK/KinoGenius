    "reviewBody": "Lmao should have known what kind of movie this was going to be with Bill Bur in it. I haven&apos;t laughed this hard at a comedy since SUPERBAD and JUMP STREET. This movie is really fun and real. Some people may actually be offended by it, but I guess that&apos;s to be expected with Bill? So here&apos;s a heads up if you are easily offended you might as well skip this movie.\n\nSome conversations and characters will remind you of a few discussions you have had on twitter and Reddit.\n\nThe story is definitely the weakest point but regardless the movie is quite fun. And I feel like the movie is more about the characters Than the story itself. All 3 lead actors did a very good job portraying their characters, and there&apos;s real brotherhood and chemistry between them.",
