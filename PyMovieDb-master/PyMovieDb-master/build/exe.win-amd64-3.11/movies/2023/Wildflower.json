    "reviewBody": "Didn&apos;t know what to expect of this movie. The title sounds good and watched in on a plane. I was so pleasantly surprised with how good it is. It&apos;s not the usual challenges a teenager will face and the cast makes everything so believable. Great acting, good script and wonderful balance of family drama, emotions, comedy and a touch of romance. There are a few times I nearly tested up. The movie is well- paced and the comedy is good too as it keeps it light hearted amidst the sadness and fry you feel for the female lead in her challenges. Highly recommend to watch and it&apos;s watchable together with your family too.",
