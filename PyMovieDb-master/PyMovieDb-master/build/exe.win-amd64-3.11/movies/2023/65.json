    "reviewBody": "Easily had more potential than what was served up. I was really looking forward to this when I seen the trailer but this had next to 0 marketing..one thing that did attract me was Sam Raimi was producing so instantly it got my attention. The CGI is so mixed one minute at the beginning it&apos;s like watching the BBC walking with Dinosaurs program that was released around 20 years ago but the CGI middle to end is good? It&apos;s like they kept the budget for the big finale but there isn&apos;t a lot of Dinosaurs in this, so if you&apos;re going with tye expectations of seeing a lot of Dinosaurs you won&apos;t get it. There&apos;s a period in the middle of the film were it just sort of trudges on with not much happening. I personally would watch it again but I won&apos;t be in a rush to and I&apos;m highly disappointed they didn&apos;t do better in every department..story action and CGI.",
