    "reviewBody": "For 2023 it&apos;s nice to see a film in theater that is high caliber. The Iron Claw hits on many different levels and tells a story with conviction and care.\n\nThe acting was convincing and the size of Zac Efron is flat out impressive (regardless if supplements were involved). In terms of drama, Efron is subtle mostly, but really shines in the final scene of the movie.\n\nThe pace is just about perfect. There is no meandering or long drawn out sequences that make you want to check the time. There are a few jumps in years but you don&apos;t get confused how long has passed, keeping the audience engaged and not confused.\n\nThe movie is based on a true story and has a lot of tragic moments, but there is also hope which helps balance the tone. The Iron Claw is a good movie and I&apos;m sure will be up for an Oscar or two. It&apos;s also nice to watch a movie in this day and age that doesn&apos;t have any political undertones that it&apos;s trying to convey to the audience, just pure storytelling.",
