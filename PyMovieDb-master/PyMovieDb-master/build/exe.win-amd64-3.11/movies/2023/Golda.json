    "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve always had a fascination with war time leaders and those of courage and fighting with bull dog spirit... From Churchill in WWII to never surrender to 1980s Iron Lady Margaret Thatcher and from The Holy Land in the Middle East... New founded Israel&apos;s only female Prime Minster &apos;Golda Meir&apos; in the 3 week long &apos;Yom Kippur War&apos; with its chain smoking coffee swigging leader keeping her cool and holding her nerve against Egypt & Syria&apos;s attack on Israel.\n\nFilm plays out day by day in the style and tension of &apos;The Darkest Hour&apos; Golda being supported by her war cabinet and defending their new founded nation from its establishing in 1948.\n\nAlso Henry Kissinger played By Liev Schreiber is just brilliant as America&apos;s Secretary of Defence and a key ally of Israel and both have this kindred spirit with both of them being Jewish from European countries, shows an understanding of what&apos;s at stake for their race\n\nHelen Mirren is just brilliant, not just in looking incredibly similar to its iconic leader but everything from mannerisms and shear determination to prevail and to defend its Nation...\n\nA nervy, adrenaline induced movie that grips from start to finish, brilliant!",
